      "Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro GOIH ComM (Portuguese pronunciation: [kɾiʃˈtjɐnu ʁɔˈnaɫdu]; born 5 February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for Premier League club Manchester United and captains the Portugal national team. Often considered the best player in the world and  widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won five Ballon d'Or awards[note 3] and four European Golden Shoes, the most by a European player. He has won 32 trophies in his career, including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, one UEFA European Championship, and one UEFA Nations League. Ronaldo holds the records for most appearances (183), most goals (140), and assists (42) in the Champions League, most goals in the European Championship (14), most international goals by a male player (115), and most international appearances by a European male (186). He is one of the few players to have made over 1,100 professional career appearances, and has scored over 800 official senior career goals for club and country.\n",
      "Ronaldo began his senior career with Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003, aged 18, winning the FA Cup in his first season. He would also go onto win three consecutive Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most expensive association football transfer when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth €94 million (£80 million), where he won 15 trophies, including two La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey, and four Champions Leagues, and became the club's all-time top goalscorer. He won back-to-back Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2016 and 2017, and was runner-up three times behind Lionel Messi, his perceived career rival. In 2018, he signed for Juventus in a transfer worth an initial €100 million (£88 million), the most expensive transfer for an Italian club and the most expensive for a player over 30 years old. He won two Serie A titles, two Supercoppe Italiana, and a Coppa Italia, before returning to United in 2021.\n",
      "Ronaldo made his international debut for Portugal in 2003 at the age of 18 and has since earned over 180 caps, making him Portugal's most-capped player. With more than 100 goals at international level, he is also the nation's all-time top goalscorer. Ronaldo has played in and scored at 11 major tournaments; he scored his first international goal at Euro 2004, where he helped Portugal reach the final. He assumed captaincy of the national team in July 2008. In 2015, Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese Football Federation. The following year, he led Portugal to their first major tournament title at Euro 2016, and received the Silver Boot as the second-highest goalscorer of the tournament. He also led them to victory in the inaugural UEFA Nations League in 2019, and later received the Golden Boot as top scorer of Euro 2020.\n",
      "One of the world's most marketable and famous athletes, Ronaldo was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2016 and 2017 and the world's most famous athlete by ESPN from 2016 to 2019. Time included him on their list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2014. He is the first footballer and the third sportsman to earn US$1 billion in his career.[8]\n",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born in the São Pedro parish of Funchal, the capital of the Portuguese island of Madeira, and grew up in the nearby parish of Santo António.[9][10] He is the fourth and youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Viveiros da Aveiro, a cook, and José Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener and part-time kit man.[11] His great-grandmother on his father's side, Isabel da Piedade, was from the island of São Vicente, Cape Verde.[12] He has one older brother, Hugo, and two older sisters, Elma and Liliana Cátia \"Katia\".[13] His mother revealed that she wanted to abort him due to poverty, his father's alcoholism and having too many children already, but her doctor refused to perform the procedure.[14] Ronaldo grew up in an impoverished Catholic home, sharing a room with all his siblings.[15]\n",
      "As a child, Ronaldo played for Andorinha from 1992 to 1995,[16] where his father was the kit man,[11] and later spent two years with Nacional. In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who signed him for a fee of £1,500.[17] He subsequently moved from Madeira to Alcochete, near Lisbon, to join Sporting's youth academy.[17] By age 14, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally and agreed with his mother to cease his education to focus entirely on football.[18] While popular with other students at school, he had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher, who he said had \"disrespected\" him.[18] One year later, he was diagnosed with tachycardia, a condition that could have forced him to give up playing football.[19] Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to cauterise multiple cardiac pathways into one, altering his resting heart rate.[20] He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and resumed training a few days later.[21]\n",

      "At age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by first-team manager László Bölöni, who was impressed with his dribbling.[22] He subsequently became the first player to play for the club's under-16, under-17 and under-18 teams, the B team and the first team, all within a single season.[17] A year later, on 29 September 2002, Ronaldo made his debut in the Primeira Liga, against Braga and on 7 October, he scored two goals against Moreirense in their 3–0 win.[23] Over the course of the 2002–03 season, his representatives suggested the player to Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier and Barcelona president Joan Laporta.[24] Manager Arsène Wenger, who was interested in signing Ronaldo, met with him at Arsenal's grounds in November to discuss a possible transfer.[25]\n",
      "Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was determined to acquire Ronaldo on a permanent move urgently, after Sporting defeated United 3–1 at the inauguration of the Estádio José Alvalade in August 2003. Initially, United had planned to sign Ronaldo and loan him back to Sporting for a year.[26] Having been impressed by him, the United players urged Ferguson to sign him. After the game, Ferguson agreed to pay Sporting £12.24 million[26] for what he considered to be \"one of the most exciting young players\" he had ever seen.[27] A decade after his departure from the club, in April 2013, Sporting honoured Ronaldo by selecting him to become their 100,000th member.[28]\n",

      "Ronaldo's move to Manchester United was completed on 12 August 2003, too late for the 2003 FA Community Shield but in time for their game against Bolton Wanderers on the opening day of the 2003–04 season, and made him the first Portuguese player to sign for the club.[30] His transfer fee made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in English football history.[31] Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the squad number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham.[32] Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo.[33] A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be Ferguson, of whom he later said: \"He's been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career.\"[34]\n",

      "Ronaldo made his debut as a substitute in a 4–0 home win over Bolton Wanderers in the Premier League on 16 August 2003, and received a standing ovation when he came on for Nicky Butt.[35] His performance earned praise from Best, who hailed it as \"undoubtedly the most exciting debut\" he had ever seen.[29] Ronaldo scored his first goal for Manchester United with a free-kick in a 3–0 win over Portsmouth on 1 November.[36] Three more league goals followed in the second half of the campaign,[37] the last of which came against Aston Villa on the final day of the season, a match in which he also received the first red card of his career.[38] Ronaldo ended his first season in English football by scoring the opening goal in United's 3–0 win over Millwall in the 2004 FA Cup Final, earning his first trophy.[39] BBC pundit Alan Hansen described him as the star of the final.[40] The British press had been critical of Ronaldo during the season for his \"elaborate\" step-overs in trying to beat opponents,[41] but teammate Gary Neville said he was \"not a show pony, but the real thing\", and predicted he would become a world-class player.[42]\n",

      "Ronaldo scored United's 1,000th Premier League goal on 29 October 2004, their only goal in a 4–1 loss to Middlesbrough.[43] A few weeks later, he signed a new contract with the club that extended his previous deal by two years to 2010.[44] At the start of 2005, Ronaldo played two of his best matches of the 2004–05 season, producing a goal and an assist against Aston Villa and scoring twice against rivals Arsenal.[45][46] He played the full 120 minutes of the 2005 FA Cup Final against Arsenal, which ended in a goalless draw; although Ronaldo scored his attempt in the penalty shoot-out, United lost 5–4.[47] Ronaldo won his second trophy in English football, the Football League Cup, after scoring the third goal in United's 4–0 final win over Wigan Athletic.[48]\n",
      "During his third season in England, Ronaldo was involved in several incidents. He had a one-match ban imposed on him by UEFA for a \"one-fingered gesture\" towards Benfica fans,[49] and was sent off in the Manchester derby (a 3–1 defeat) for kicking Manchester City's former United player Andy Cole.[50] Ronaldo clashed with a teammate, striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who took offence at the winger's showboating style of play.[51] Following the 2006 FIFA World Cup, in which he was involved in an incident where club teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off,[52] Ronaldo publicly asked for a transfer, lamenting the lack of support he felt he had received from the club over the incident.[53] United denied the possibility of him leaving the club.[54]\n",
      "Although his World Cup altercation with Rooney resulted in Ronaldo being booed throughout the 2006–07 season,[55] it proved to be his breakout year, as he broke the 20-goal barrier for the first time and won his first Premier League title. An important factor in this success was his one-to-one training by first-team coach René Meulensteen, who taught him to make himself more unpredictable, improve his teamwork, call for the ball and capitalise on goalscoring opportunities rather than waiting for the chance to score the aesthetically pleasing goals for which he was already known.[56] He scored three consecutive braces at the end of December, against Aston Villa (a win that put United on top of the league), Wigan and Reading.[57][58][59] Ronaldo was named the Premier League Player of the Month in November and December, becoming only the third player to receive consecutive honours.[60]\n",

      "At the quarter-final stage of the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League, Ronaldo scored his first goals in his 30th match in the competition,[61] scoring twice in a 7–1 win over Roma.[62] He subsequently scored four minutes into the first semi-final leg against Milan, which ended in a 3–2 win,[63] but was marked out of the second leg as United lost 3–0 at the San Siro.[64] He also helped United reach the 2007 FA Cup Final, but the final against Chelsea ended in a 1–0 defeat.[65] Ronaldo scored the only goal in the Manchester derby on 5 May (his 50th goal for the club), as United won their first league title in four years.[66] As a result of his performances, he amassed a host of personal awards for the season. He won the Professional Footballers' Association's Player's Player, Fans' Player and Young Player of the Year awards, as well as the Football Writers' Association's Footballer of the Year award,[67][68] becoming the first player to win all four main PFA and FWA honours.[69] His wages were concurrently upgraded to £120,000 a week as part of a five-year contract extension.[70] Ronaldo was named runner-up to Kaká for the 2007 Ballon d'Or,[71] and came third, behind Kaká and Lionel Messi, in the running for the 2007 FIFA World Player of the Year award.[72]\n",
      "Ronaldo scored his first and only hat-trick for United in a 6–0 win against Newcastle United on 12 January 2008, which put United top of the league table.[73] On 19 March, he captained United for the first time in a home win over Bolton and scored both goals in a 2–0 win.[74] His second goal was his 33rd of the campaign, which bettered George Best's total of 32 goals in the 1967–68 season, thus setting the club's new single-season record by a midfielder.[75] His 31 league goals earned him the Premier League Golden Boot,[76] as well as the European Golden Shoe, which made him the first winger to win the latter award.[77] He additionally received the PFA Players' Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year awards for the second consecutive season.[78][79] In the knockout stage of the Champions League, Ronaldo scored the decisive goal against Lyon, which helped United advance to the quarter-finals 2–1 on aggregate;[80] while playing as a striker, he scored with a header in the 3–0 aggregate win over Roma.[81] United reached the final against Chelsea in Moscow, where, despite his opening goal being negated by an equaliser and his penalty kick being saved in the shoot-out,[82] United emerged victorious.[83] As the Champions League top scorer, Ronaldo was named the UEFA Club Footballer of the Year.[84]\n",
      "Ronaldo scored a total of 42 goals in all competitions during the 2007–08 season, his most prolific campaign during his time in England. He missed three matches after headbutting a Portsmouth player at the start of the season, an experience he said taught him not to let opponents provoke him.[85] As rumours circulated of Ronaldo's interest in moving to Real Madrid, United filed a tampering complaint with governing body FIFA over Madrid's alleged pursuit of their player, but they declined to take action.[86] FIFA president Sepp Blatter asserted that the player should be allowed to leave his club, describing the situation as \"modern slavery\".[87] Despite Ronaldo publicly agreeing with Blatter,[88] he remained at United for another year.[89]\n",

      "His match-winning goal in the second leg against Porto, a 40-yard strike, earned him the inaugural FIFA Puskás Award, presented by FIFA in recognition of the best goal of the year;[98] he later called it the best goal he had ever scored.[99] United advanced to the final in Rome,[100] where he made little impact in United's 2–0 defeat to Barcelona.[101] Ronaldo ended his time in England with nine trophies, as United claimed their third successive league title and a Football League Cup.[102][103] He finished the campaign with 26 goals in all competitions, 16 goals fewer than the previous season, in four more appearances.[104] His final goal for United came on 10 May 2009 with a free kick in the Manchester derby at Old Trafford.[105]\n",

      "Ahead of the 2009–10 season, Ronaldo joined Real Madrid for a world record transfer fee at the time, of £80 million (€94 million).[106] His contract, which ran until 2015, was worth €11 million per year and contained a €1 billion buy-out clause.[107] At least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the Santiago Bernabéu, surpassing the 25-year record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed Diego Maradona at Napoli.[108] Since club captain Raúl already wore the number 7 (the number Ronaldo wore at United), Ronaldo received the number 9 shirt,[109] which was presented to him by former Madrid player Alfredo Di Stéfano.[110]\n",

      "Ronaldo made his La Liga debut against Deportivo La Coruña on 29 August, scoring a penalty in a 3–2 home win.[111] He scored in each of his first four league games, the first Madrid player to do so.[112] His first Champions League goals for the club followed with two free kicks in the first group match against Zürich.[113] His strong start to the season was interrupted when he suffered an ankle injury in October while on international duty, which kept him sidelined for seven weeks.[114][115] A week after his return, he received his first red card in Spain in a match against Almería.[116] Midway through the season, Ronaldo finished second in the 2009 Ballon d'Or and the 2009 FIFA World Player of the Year awards, behind Messi. He finished the season with 33 goals in all competitions, including a hat-trick in a 4–1 win against Mallorca on 5 May 2010, his first in La Liga.[117][118] His first season at Madrid ended trophyless.[119]\n",
      "Following Raúl's departure, Ronaldo was given the number 7 shirt for Madrid before the 2010–11 season.[120] His subsequent return to his Ballon d'Or-winning form was epitomised when, for the first time in his career, he scored four goals in a single match during a 6–1 rout against Racing Santander on 23 October.[121] Ronaldo subsequently scored further hat-tricks against Athletic Bilbao, Levante, Villarreal and Málaga.[122][123][124] Despite his performances, he did not make the top three in the inaugural 2010 FIFA Ballon d'Or.[125] During a historic series of four Clásicos against rivals Barcelona in April 2011, Ronaldo scored twice to equal his personal record of 42 goals in all competitions. Though he failed to score in either leg of the Champions League semi-finals as Madrid were eliminated, he equalised from the penalty spot in the return league game and scored the match-winning goal in the 103rd minute of the 2011 Copa del Rey Final, winning his first trophy in Spain.[126][127] His two goals in the last match of the season against Almería made him the first player in La Liga to score 40 goals.[128] In addition to the Pichichi Trophy, Ronaldo won the European Golden Shoe for a second time, becoming the first player to win the award in different leagues.[129]\n",

      " Ronaldo scored 46 league goals during the La Liga championship success in his third season in Spain.\n",
      "During the following season, Ronaldo achieved a new personal best of 60 goals in all competitions.[130] He finished as runner-up to Messi for the 2011 FIFA Ballon d'Or, after scoring hat-tricks against Real Zaragoza, Rayo Vallecano, Málaga, Osasuna and Sevilla, the last of which put Madrid on top of the league by the season's midway point.[131][132][133] Ronaldo found greater team success in the league, helping Madrid win their first league title in four years with a record 100 points. Following a hat-trick against Levante as Madrid further increased their lead over Barcelona,[134] he scored his 100th league goal for Madrid in a 5–1 win over Real Sociedad on 24 March 2012, a milestone he reached in just 92 matches across three seasons, breaking the previous club record held by Ferenc Puskás.[135] Another hat-trick in the Madrid derby against Atlético Madrid brought his total to 40 league goals, equalling his record of the previous season.[136] His final league goal of the season, against Mallorca, took his total to 46 goals, four short of the new record set by Messi,[137] though he became the first player to score against all 19 opposition teams in a single La Liga season.[138]\n",
      "Ronaldo began the 2012–13 season by lifting the 2012 Supercopa de España, his third trophy in Spain. With a goal in each leg, he helped Madrid win the Spanish Super Cup on away goals following a 4–4 aggregate draw against Barcelona.[139] Although Ronaldo publicly commented that he was unhappy with a \"professional issue\" within the club, prompted by his refusal to celebrate his 150th goal for Madrid,[140] his goalscoring rate did not suffer. After netting a hat-trick, including two penalties, against Deportivo, he scored his first hat-trick in the Champions League in a 4–1 win over Ajax.[141] Four days later, he became the first player to score in six successive Clásicos when he hit a brace in a 2–2 draw at Camp Nou.[142] His performances again saw Ronaldo voted second in the running for the 2012 FIFA Ballon d'Or, behind four-time winner Messi.[143]\n",

After scoring the equaliser in a 1–1 draw at home,[150] he scored the winning goal in a 2–1 win on his first return to Old Trafford.[151] He did not celebrate scoring against his former club as a mark of respect.[152] After scoring three goals against Galatasaray in the quarters, he scored Madrid's only goal in the 4–1 away defeat to Borussia Dortmund in the semi-finals and Real were eliminated at the semi-final stage for the third consecutive year despite a 2–0 win in the second leg.[153]\n",

      "Concurrently with his individual achievements, Ronaldo enjoyed his greatest team success in Spain to date, as he helped Madrid win La Décima, their tenth European Cup. His goal in a 3–0 home win over Dortmund (his 100th Champions League match) took his total for the season to 14 goals, equalling the record Messi had set two years before.[162] After hitting a brace in a 4–0 defeat of Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena,[163] he scored from the penalty spot in the 120th minute of the 4–1 final win over Atlético, becoming the first player to score in two European Cup finals for two different winning teams.[164] His overall performance in the final was subdued as a result of patellar tendinitis and related hamstring problems, which had plagued him in the last months of the campaign. Ronaldo played the final against medical advice, later commenting: \"In your life you do not win without sacrifices and you must take risks\".[165] As the competition's top goalscorer for the third time, with a record 17 goals,[166] he was named the UEFA Best Player in Europe.[167]\n",
      "In the Copa del Rey, Ronaldo helped Madrid reach the final by scoring two penalties against Atlético at the Vicente Calderón,[168] the first of which meant he had now scored in every single minute of a 90-minute football match.[169] His continued issues with his knee and thigh caused him to miss the final, where Madrid defeated Barcelona 2–1 to claim the trophy.[170] Ronaldo scored 31 goals in 30 league games, which earned him the Pichichi and the European Golden Shoe, receiving the latter award jointly with Liverpool striker Luis Suárez.[171] Among his haul was his 400th career goal, in 653 appearances for club and country, which came with a brace against Celta Vigo on 6 January; he dedicated his goals to compatriot Eusébio, who had died two days before.[172] A last-minute, back-heeled volley scored against Valencia on 4 May (his 50th goal in all competitions) was recognised as the best goal of the season by the Liga Nacional de Fútbol Profesional,[173] which additionally named Ronaldo the Best Player in La Liga.[174]\n",

Although the referee later clarified that the red card was only due to Rooney's infraction,[303] the English media speculated that Ronaldo had influenced his decision by aggressively complaining, after which he was seen in replays winking at Portugal's bench following Rooney's dismissal.[296][304] Ronaldo went on to score the vital winning penalty during the shoot-out which sent Portugal into the semi-finals.[296] Ronaldo was subsequently booed during their 1–0 semi-final defeat to France.[305] FIFA's Technical Study Group overlooked him for the tournament's Best Young Player award and handed it to Germany's Lukas Podolski, citing his behaviour as a factor in the decision.[296][306] Following the 2006 World Cup, Ronaldo would go on to represent Portugal in four qualifying games for Euro 2008, scoring two goals in the process.[307][308]\n",

      "A versatile attacker, Ronaldo is capable of playing on either wing as well as through the centre of the pitch,[399] and, while ostensibly right-footed, is very strong with both feet.[400] Tactically, Ronaldo has undergone several evolutions throughout his career. While at Sporting and during his first season at Manchester United, he was typically deployed as a traditional winger on the right side of midfield, where he regularly looked to deliver crosses into the penalty area. In this position, he was able to use his pace and acceleration, agility and technical skills to take on opponents in one-on-one situations. Ronaldo became noted for his dribbling and flair, often displaying an array of tricks and feints,[401][402] such as the step overs and so-called 'chops' that became his trademark;[403] he has also been known to use the flip–flap.[404]\n",
      "\n",
      " Ronaldo controlling the ball on his chest during a 2010–11 La Liga game against Almería. At his peak, he was known for his exceptional speed and athleticism.[405]\n",
      "As Ronaldo matured, he underwent a major physical transformation, developing a muscular body type that allowed him to retain possession of the ball under pressure, and strong legs that enabled an outstanding jumping ability.[406] His strength and jumping ability, combined with his elevation, heading accuracy and height of 1.87 m (6 ft 1+1⁄2 in), give him an edge in winning aerial duels. These attributes allow him to function as a target-man and make him an aerial goal threat in the penalty area; consequently, many of his goals have been headers.[407][408][409] Allied with his increased stamina and work-rate, his goalscoring ability improved drastically on the left wing where he was given the positional freedom to move into the centre to finish attacks. He has also increasingly played a creative role for his team, often dropping deep to pick up the ball, participate in the build-up of plays and create chances for his teammates, courtesy of his vision and passing ability.[401][407]\n",
      "In his final seasons at United, Ronaldo played an even more attacking and central role, functioning both as a striker and as a supporting forward, or even as an attacking midfielder on occasion.[407] He developed into a prolific goalscorer, capable of finishing well both inside the penalty area and from distance with an accurate and powerful shot, courtesy of his striking ability.[407][410] An accurate penalty kick taker,[411] he also became a set piece specialist, renowned for his powerful, bending free kicks.[412] When taking free kicks, Ronaldo is known for using the knuckleball technique, which was developed by Juninho Pernambucano.[413] He also adopts a trademark stance before striking the ball, which involves him standing with his legs far apart.[414] Regarding Ronaldo's unique style of taking free kicks, former Manchester United assistant manager Mike Phelan commented: \"People used to put the ball down, walk away, run up and hit it. He brought in a more dynamic showmanship. He places the ball down, the concentration level is high, he takes his certain amount of steps back so that his standing foot is in the perfect place to hit the ball in the sweet spot. He is the ultimate showman. He has that slight arrogance. When he pulls those shorts up and shows his thighs, he is saying 'All eyes on me' and this is going in. He understands the marketing side of it. The way he struts up and places it; the world is watching him.\"[415]\n",
      "\n",
      " As Ronaldo entered his thirties he began to dribble less.[416]\n",
      "At Real Madrid, Ronaldo continued to play a more offensive role, while his creative and defensive duties became more limited, although not entirely diminished.[417] Initially deployed as a centre forward by managers Manuel Pellegrini and José Mourinho, he was later moved back onto the left wing, though in a free tactical role; this position allowed him to drift into the centre at will to get onto the end of crosses and score, or draw out defenders with his movement off the ball and leave space for teammates to exploit.[417][418][419] Madrid's counter-attacking style of play also allowed him to become a more efficient and consistent player, as evidenced by his record-breaking goalscoring feats. While he mainly drew praise in the media for his prolific goalscoring, Ronaldo also demonstrated his ability as an effective creator in this role.[420][421][422] This unique role has been described by pundits as that of a \"false\", \"attacking\", or \"goalscoring winger\", as Ronaldo effectively almost functioned as a striker at times with his central runs into the penalty area, despite actually playing on the left flank.[418][423] From 2013 onwards, under manager Carlo Ancelotti, he effectively adapted his style to the physical effects of ageing with increasingly reduced off-the-ball movement and general involvement, completing fewer dribbles and passes per game, and instead focusing on short-distance creating and goalscoring.[417][424][425] Since 2017, Ronaldo adapted his style of play yet again to become more of a free-roaming centre forward under manager Zinedine Zidane, a role in which he continued to excel and maintain a prolific goalscoring record; in this position, he earned praise in the media for his intelligent movement both on and off the ball, positional sense, link-up play and finishing, as well as his ability to lose or anticipate his markers, find space in the box and score from few touches or opportunities.[426][427][428]\n",
      "In his first season at Juventus, Ronaldo continued to play in a variety of different attacking roles under manager Massimiliano Allegri, depending on whom he was partnered with. While he had occupied an increasingly offensive role in his final years at Real Madrid, at times he functioned in a free role at Juventus, either as a lone striker or in his trademark role on the left wing, in a 4–2–3–1 or 4–3–3 formation, in which he often switched positions with Mario Mandžukić. In this role, he was also given licence to drop deep or even out wide onto the right flank to receive the ball, and be more involved in the build-up of plays; as such, aside from scoring goals himself, he began to take on opponents and create chances for other players with greater frequency than he had in his final seasons with Real Madrid. Off the ball, he was also capable of creating space for teammates with his movement and attacking runs into the box, or finishing off chances with his head or feet by getting onto the end of his teammates' crosses.[429][430] On occasion he also played in an attacking partnership alongside Mandžukić in a 4–3–1–2, 4–4–2, or 3–5–2 formation.[431][432][433] He continued to play a similar role in his second season with the club under manager Maurizio Sarri.[430]\n",

      "Ronaldo is noted for his work ethic, elite body conditioning and dedication to improvement on the training pitch, as well being regarded as a natural leader.[440][441] On his longevity and \"extraordinary commitment to physical preparation\", Adam Bate of Sky Sports said: \"Dedication is a huge part of staying at the top and Ronaldo's focus is perhaps unparalleled within the game.\"[416] While stating they were stylistically different players who shared an equal desire to score goals, former Brazil international Ronaldo praised Cristiano's approach to training, arguing that \"there are so few players who take care of their body like he does. I trained because I had to, he does it because he loves it.\"[442] His drive and determination to succeed are fuelled by a desire to be talked about alongside other greats such as Pelé and Diego Maradona once retiring.[443] He is credited, along with his compatriot, coach José Mourinho, with inspiring changing fortunes of Portuguese football in 2010s and 2020s.[444] At times, he has been criticised for simulating when tackled.[445] He was also occasionally criticised early in his career by manager Alex Ferguson, teammates and the media for being a selfish or overly flamboyant player.[446] Jonathan Wilson of The Guardian opined that Ronaldo had made Juventus, who he joined aged 33 in 2018, weaker, due to \"his relative immobility\" in his mid-30s, even if his personal goal-scoring output remained high.[447]\n",
      "During his career, Ronaldo has also been described as having an \"arrogant image\" on the pitch,[448] with Ronaldo stating that he had become a \"victim\" because of how he was portrayed in the media.[449] He is often seen moaning, gesticulating and scowling while trying to inspire his team to victory,[448] with Ronaldo insisting that his competitive nature should not be mistaken for arrogance.[449] His managers, teammates and various journalists have said that this reputation has caused an unfair image of him.[450][451][452]\n",

I think they have their own personal pride in terms of wanting to be the best.\"[468] Messi himself denied any rivalry, saying that it was \"only the media, the press, who wants us to be at loggerheads but I've never fought with Cristiano.\"[469] Responding to the claims that he and Messi do not get on well on a personal level, Ronaldo commented: \"We don't have a relationship outside the world of football, just as we don't with a lot of other players.\" Ronaldo added that in years to come he hopes they can laugh about it together, stating: \"We have to look on this rivalry with a positive spirit, because it's a good thing.\"[466] Representing archrivals Barcelona and Real Madrid, the two players faced each other at least twice every season in the world's biggest club game, El Clásico, which is among the world's most viewed annual sporting events.[470]\n",
      "In a debate at Oxford Union in October 2013, when asked whether FIFA president Sepp Blatter preferred Messi or Ronaldo, Blatter paid tribute to the work ethic of the Argentine before taking a swipe at Ronaldo, claiming \"one of them has more expenses for the hairdresser than the other.\" Real Madrid demanded and promptly received a full apology. In response to Blatter's \"commander\" on the pitch comment, Ronaldo issued his own riposte with a mock-salute celebration after scoring a penalty against Sevilla.[471] In August 2019, Ronaldo and Messi were interviewed while sat next to each other prior to the announcement of the UEFA Men's Player of the Year, with Ronaldo stating: \"I pushed him and he pushed me as well. So it's good to be part of the history of football.\"[472]\n",

Often considered the best player in the world and widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won a record seven Ballon d\\'Or awards,[note 2] a record six European Golden Shoes, and in 2020 was named to the Ballon d\\'Or Dream Team. Until leaving the club in 2021, he had spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he won a club-record 35 trophies, including ten La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles and four UEFA Champions Leagues. A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals in La Liga (474), a La Liga and European league season (50), most hat-tricks in La Liga (36) and the UEFA Champions League (8), and most assists in La Liga (192), a La Liga season (21) and the Copa América (17). He also holds the record for most international goals by a South American male (81). Messi has scored over 750 senior career goals for club and country, and has the most goals by a player for a single club.\\nBorn and raised in central Argentina, Messi relocated to Spain to join Barcelona at age 13, for whom he made his competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. He established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, and in his first uninterrupted season in 2008–09 he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi won his first Ballon d\\'Or. Three successful seasons followed, with Messi winning four consecutive Ballons d\\'Or, making him the first player to win the award four times and in a row.[10] During the 2011–12 season, he set the La Liga and European records for most goals scored in a single season, while establishing himself as Barcelona\\'s all-time top scorer. The following two seasons, Messi finished second for the Ballon d\\'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo (his perceived career rival), before regaining his best form during the 2014–15 campaign, becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, after which he was awarded a fifth Ballon d\\'Or in 2015. Messi assumed captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and in 2019 he won a record sixth Ballon d\\'Or. Out of contract, he signed for Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021.\\nAn Argentine international, Messi is both his country\\'s highest appearance-maker and their all-time leading goalscorer. At youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship, finishing the tournament with both the Golden Ball and Golden Shoe, and an Olympic gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew comparisons with his compatriot Diego Maradona, who described Messi as his successor. After his senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a FIFA World Cup in 2006, and reached the final of the 2007 Copa América, where he was named young player of the tournament. As the squad\\'s captain from August 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals: the 2014 FIFA World Cup, for which he won the Golden Ball, and the 2015 and 2016 Copa América, winning the Golden Ball in the 2015 edition. After announcing his international retirement in 2016, he reversed his decision and led his country to qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a third-place finish at the 2019 Copa América, and won the 2021 Copa América, while winning the Golden Ball and Golden Boot award for the latter. This achievement would see him receive a record seventh Ballon d\\'Or in 2021.\\nMessi has endorsed sportswear company Adidas since 2006. According to France Football, he was the world\\'s highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014, and was ranked the world\\'s highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2019. Messi was among Time\\'s 100 most influential people in the world in 2011 and 2012. In February 2020, he was awarded the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year, thus becoming the first footballer and the first team sport athlete to win the award. Later that year, Messi became the second footballer (and second team-sport athlete) to surpass $1 billion in career earnings.\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 Early life\\n2 Club career\\n\\n2.1 Barcelona\\n\\n2.1.1 2003–2005: Rise to the first team\\n2.1.2 2005–2008: Becoming a starting eleven player\\n2.1.3 2008–09: First treble\\n2.1.4 2009–10: First Ballon d\\'Or\\n2.1.5 2010–11: Fifth La Liga title and third Champions League\\n2.1.6 2012: A record-breaking year\\n2.1.7 2013–14: Messidependencia\\n2.1.8 2014–15: Second treble\\n2.1.9 2015–16: Domestic success\\n2.1.10 2016–17: Fourth Golden Boot\\n2.1.11 2017–18: Domestic double and a record fifth Golden Boot\\n2.1.12 2018–19: Captain, 10th La Liga title, and a record sixth Golden Boot\\n2.1.13 2019–20: A record sixth Ballon d\\'Or\\n2.1.14 August 2020: Desire to leave Barcelona\\n2.1.15 2020–21: Final season at Barcelona\\n\\n\\n2.2 Paris Saint-Germain\\n\\n2.2.1 2021–22: Seventh Ballon d\\'Or\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3 International career\\n\\n3.1 2004–05: Success at youth level\\n3.2 2005–06: Senior and World Cup debuts\\n3.3 2007–08: Copa América final and Olympic gold\\n3.4 2008–2011: Collective decline\\n3.5 2011–2013: Assuming the captaincy\\n3.6 2014–15: World Cup and Copa América finals\\n3.7 2016–17: Third Copa América final, retirement, and return\\n\\n3.7.1 Return\\n\\n\\n3.8 2018: World Cup\\n3.9 2019–20: Copa América third-place, suspension and Superclásico victory\\n3.10 2021: Appearance record, Copa América victory and South American top goalscorer\\n\\n\\n4 Player profile\\n\\n4.1 Style of play\\n4.2 Reception\\n4.3 Comparisons to Cristiano Ronaldo\\n\\n\\n5 In popular culture\\n6 Personal life\\n\\n6.1 Family and relationships\\n6.2 Philanthropy\\n6.3 Tax fraud\\n\\n\\n7 Career statistics\\n\\n7.1 Club\\n7.2 International\\n\\n\\n8 Honours\\n9 See also\\n10 Notes\\n11 References\\n12 External links\\n\\n\\n\\nEarly life\\nMessi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, Santa Fe,[11] the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father\\'s side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from the northcentral Adriatic Marche region of Italy and Catalonia, and on his mother\\'s side, he has primarily Italian ancestry.[5] Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, \"Leo\" developed a passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Matías, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers.[12] At the age of four he joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches.[13] He was greatly affected by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a devout Catholic, he has celebrated his goals by looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute to his grandmother.[14][15]\\n\\n\\n\\n\"When you saw him you would think: this kid can\\'t play ball. He\\'s a dwarf, he\\'s too fragile, too small. But immediately you\\'d realise that he was born different, that he was a phenomenon and that he was going to be something impressive.\"\\n\\n\\n– Newell\\'s Old Boys youth coach Adrián Coria shares his first impression of the 12-year-old Messi.[16]\\n\\n\\nA lifelong supporter of Newell\\'s Old Boys, Messi joined the Rosario club when he was six years old. During the six years he played for Newell\\'s, he scored almost 500 goals as a member of \"The Machine of \\'87\", the near-unbeatable youth side named for the year of their birth, and regularly entertained crowds by performing ball tricks during half-time of the first team\\'s home games.[17][18] However, his future as a professional player was threatened when, at age 10, he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency. As his father\\'s health insurance covered only two years of growth hormone treatment, which cost at least $1,000 per month, Newell\\'s agreed to contribute, but later reneged on their promise.[19] He was scouted by Buenos Aires club River Plate, whose playmaker, Pablo Aimar, he idolised, but they were also unable to pay for his treatment due to Argentina\\'s economic collapse.[20][21] His goalscoring idol growing up was Ronaldo, with Messi calling him \"the best forward I\\'ve ever seen\".[22]\\n\\n Messi enrolled at Barcelona\\'s youth academy, La Masia, at age 13.\\nAs the Messi family had relatives in Catalonia, they sought to arrange a trial with Barcelona in September 2000. First team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him, but the board of directors hesitated; at the time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On 14 December, an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with no other paper at hand, offered a contract on a paper napkin.[20][23] In February 2001, the family relocated to Barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club\\'s stadium, Camp Nou. During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the Infantiles due to a transfer conflict with Newell\\'s; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by nature, he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute. At home, he suffered from homesickness after his mother moved back to Rosario with his brothers and little sister, María Sol, while he stayed in Barcelona with his father.[17][23][24]\\nAfter a year at Barcelona\\'s youth academy, La Masia, Messi was finally enrolled in the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) in February 2002. Now playing in all competitions, he befriended his teammates, among whom were Cesc Fàbregas and Gerard Piqué.[25] After completing his growth hormone treatment aged 14,[26] Messi became an integral part of the \"Baby Dream Team\", Barcelona\\'s greatest-ever youth side. During his first full season (2002–03), he was top scorer with 36 goals in 30 games for the Cadetes A, who won an unprecedented treble of the league and both the Spanish and Catalan cups.[25][27] The Copa Catalunya final, a 4–1 victory over Espanyol, became known in club lore as the partido de la máscara, the final of the mask. A week after suffering a broken cheekbone during a league match, Messi was allowed to start the game on the condition that he wear a plastic protector; soon hindered by the mask, he took it off and scored two goals in 10 minutes before his substitution.[28] At the close of the season, he received an offer to join Arsenal, his first from a foreign club, but while Fàbregas and Piqué soon left for England, he chose to remain in Barcelona.[23][29][30]\\n\\nClub career\\nBarcelona\\n2003–2005: Rise to the first team\\n\\n\\n\"It seemed as if he had been playing with us all his life.\"\\n\\n\\n– Barcelona\\'s then assistant coach Henk ten Cate on Messi\\'s first-team debut.[31]\\n\\n\\nDuring the 2003–04 season, his fourth with Barcelona, Messi rapidly progressed through the club\\'s ranks, debuting for a record five youth teams in a single campaign.[32] After being named player of the tournament in four international pre-season competitions with the Juveniles B, he played only one official match with the team before being promoted to the Juveniles A, where he scored 18 goals in 11 league games.[33][34] Messi was then one of several youth players called up to strengthen a depleted first team during the international break. French winger Ludovic Giuly explained how a teenage Leo caught the eye in a training session with Frank Rijkaard\\'s first team: \"He destroyed us all... They were kicking him all over the place to avoid being ridiculed by this kid, he just got up and kept on playing. He would dribble past four players and score a goal. Even the team\\'s starting centre-backs were nervous. He was an alien.\"[35]\\nAt 16 years, four months, and 23 days old, Messi made his first team debut when he came on in the 75th minute during a friendly against José Mourinho\\'s Porto on 16 November 2003.[23][36] His performance, creating two chances and a shot on goal, impressed the technical staff, and he subsequently began training daily with the club\\'s reserve side, Barcelona B, as well as weekly with the first team.[37] After his first training session with the senior squad, Barça\\'s new star player, Ronaldinho, told his teammates that he believed the 16-year-old would become an even better player than himself.[38] Ronaldinho soon befriended Messi, whom he called \"little brother\", which greatly eased his transition into the first team.[39][40]\\n\\n Messi playing against Málaga in 2005\\nTo gain further match experience, Messi joined Barcelona C in addition to the Juveniles A, playing his first game for the third team on 29 November. He helped save them from the relegation zone of the Tercera División, scoring five goals in ten games, including a hat-trick in eight minutes during a Copa del Rey match while man-marked by Sevilla\\'s Sergio Ramos.[33][41] His progress was reflected in his first professional contract, signed on 4 February 2004, which lasted until 2012 and contained an initial buyout clause of €30\\xa0million. A month later, on 6 March, he made his debut for Barcelona B in the Segunda División B, and his buyout clause automatically increased to €80\\xa0million.[33][42] He played five games with the B team that season but did not score.[43] Physically he was weaker than his opponents, who were often much older and taller, and in training he worked on increasing his muscle mass and overall strength in order to be able to shake off defenders. Towards the end of the season, he returned to both youth teams, helping the Juveniles B win the league. He finished the campaign having scored for four of his five teams with a total of 36 goals in all official competitions.[33][41]\\nDuring the 2004–05 season, Messi was a guaranteed starter for the B team, playing 17 games throughout the campaign and scoring on six occasions.[38][44] Since his debut the previous November, he had not been called up to the first team again, but in October 2004, the senior players asked manager Frank Rijkaard to promote him.[38] Since Ronaldinho already played on the left wing, Rijkaard moved Messi from his usual position onto the right flank (though initially against the player\\'s wishes), allowing him to cut into the centre of the pitch and shoot with his dominant left foot.[45][46] Messi made his league debut during the next match on 16 October, against Espanyol, coming on in the 82nd minute.[23] At 17 years, three months, and 22 days old, he was at the time the youngest player to represent Barcelona in an official competition.[40] As a substitute player, he played 244 minutes in nine matches for the first team that season, including his debut in the UEFA Champions League against Shakhtar Donetsk.[44] He scored his first senior goal on 1 May 2005, against Albacete, from an assist by Ronaldinho, becoming – at that time – the youngest-ever scorer for the club.[45][47] Barcelona, in their second season under Rijkaard, won the league for the first time in six years.[48]\\n\\n2005–2008: Becoming a starting eleven player\\n\\n\\n\"In my entire life I have never seen a player of such quality and personality at such a young age, particularly wearing the \\'heavy\\' shirt of one of the world\\'s great clubs.\"\\n\\n\\n– Fabio Capello praises the 18-year-old Messi following the Joan Gamper trophy in August 2005.[49]\\n\\n\\nOn 24 June, his 18th birthday, Messi signed his first contract as a senior team player. It made him a Barcelona player until 2010, two years less than his previous contract, but his buyout clause increased to €150\\xa0million.[42] His breakthrough came two months later, on 24 August, during the Joan Gamper Trophy, Barcelona\\'s pre-season competition. A starter for the first time, he gave a well-received performance against Fabio Capello\\'s Juventus, receiving an ovation from the Camp Nou.[49] While Capello requested to loan Messi, a bid to buy him came from Inter Milan, who were willing to pay his €150\\xa0million buyout clause and triple his wages.[50] According to then-president Joan Laporta, it was the only time the club faced a real risk of losing Messi, but he ultimately decided to stay.[51] On 16 September, his contract was updated for the second time in three months and extended to 2014.[42][52]\\n\\n Messi during a training session with Barcelona in 2006\\nDue to issues regarding his legal status in the Royal Spanish Football Federation, Messi missed the start of La Liga, but on 26 September, he acquired Spanish citizenship and became eligible to play.[52][53] Wearing the number 19 shirt, he gradually established himself as the first-choice right winger, forming an attacking trio with Ronaldinho and striker Samuel Eto\\'o.[30][54][55] He was in the starting line-up in major matches like his first Clásico against rivals Real Madrid on 19 November, as well as Barcelona\\'s away victory over Chelsea in the last 16 round of the Champions League,[56][54] which came on back of an intense period of rivalry between the clubs leading a resentful Messi to state, \"We would rather play Arsenal, Manchester United or anyone else than be on the pitch with Chelsea.\"[57] After he had scored 8 goals in 25 games, including his first in the Champions League,[58] in a 5–0 win over Panathinaikos on 2 November 2005,[59] his season ended prematurely during the return leg against Chelsea on 7 March 2006, when he suffered a torn hamstring. Messi worked to regain fitness in time for the Champions League final, but on 17 May, the day of the final, he was eventually ruled out. He was so disappointed that he did not celebrate his team\\'s victory over Arsenal in Paris, something he later came to regret.[48][54]\\nWhile Barcelona began a gradual decline, the 19-year-old Messi established himself as one of the best players in the world during the 2006–07 campaign.[60][61] Already an idol to the culés, the club\\'s supporters, he scored 17 goals in 36 games across all competitions.[61][62] However, he continued to be plagued by major injuries; a metatarsal fracture sustained on 12 November 2006 kept him out of action for three months.[63][64] He recovered in time for the last 16 round of the Champions League against Liverpool, but was effectively marked out of the game; Barcelona, the reigning champions, were out of the competition.[65] In the league, his goal contribution increased towards the end of the season; 11 of his 14 goals came from the last 13 games.[62] On 10 March 2007, he scored his first hat-trick in a Clásico, the first player to do so in 12 years, equalising after each goal by Real Madrid to end the match in a 3–3 draw in injury time.[66] His growing importance to the club was reflected in a new contract, signed that month, which greatly increased his wages.[67]\\n\\n Messi making his Maradona-esque run against Getafe in 2007\\nAlready frequently compared to compatriot Diego Maradona, Messi proved their similarity when he nearly replicated Maradona\\'s two most famous goals in the span of seven weeks.[68] During a Copa del Rey semi-final against Getafe on 18 April, he scored a goal remarkably similar to Maradona\\'s second goal in the quarter-finals of the 1986 FIFA World Cup, known as the Goal of the Century. Messi collected the ball on the right side near the halfway line, ran 60 metres (66\\xa0yd), and beat five defenders before scoring with an angled finish, just as Maradona had done.[20][69] A league match against Espanyol on 9 June saw him score by launching himself at the ball and guiding it past the goalkeeper with his hand in similar fashion to Maradona\\'s Hand of God goal in the same World Cup match.[70] As Messi continued his individual rise, Barcelona faltered; the team failed to reach the Copa del Rey final after Messi was rested during the second leg against Getafe and lost the league to Real Madrid on head-to-head results.[71][72]\\nAfter Ronaldinho lost form, Messi became Barça\\'s new star player at only 20 years old, receiving the nickname \"Messiah\" from the Spanish media.[20][73][74] His efforts in 2007 also earned him award recognition; journalists voted him the third-best player of the year for the 2007 Ballon d\\'Or, behind Kaká and runner-up Cristiano Ronaldo, while international managers and national team captains voted him second for the FIFA World Player of the Year award, again behind Kaká.[75][76] Although he managed to score 16 goals  during the 2007–08 campaign,[77] the second half of his season was again marred by injuries after he suffered a torn hamstring on 15 December.[78] He returned to score twice in their away victory against Celtic in the last 16 round of the Champions League, becoming the competition\\'s top scorer at that point with six goals,[79] but reinjured himself during the return leg on 4 March 2008. Rijkaard had fielded him despite warning from the medical staff, leading captain Carles Puyol to criticise the Spanish media for pressuring Messi to play every match.[78] Barcelona finished the season without trophies, eliminated in the Champions League semi-finals by the eventual champions, Manchester United, and placed third in the league.[80]\\n\\n2008–09: First treble\\nAfter two unsuccessful seasons, Barcelona were in need of an overhaul, leading to the departure of Rijkaard and Ronaldinho. Upon the latter\\'s departure, Messi was given the number 10 shirt.[55] He signed a new contract in July with an annual salary of €7.8\\xa0million, becoming the club\\'s highest-paid player.[81][82] Ahead of the new season, a major concern remained his frequent muscular injuries, which had left him side-lined for a total of eight months between 2006 and 2008. To combat the problem, the club implemented new training, nutrition, and lifestyle regimens, and assigned him a personal physiotherapist, who would travel with him during call-ups for the Argentina national team. As a result, Messi remained virtually injury-free during the next four years, allowing him to reach his full potential.[64][83] Despite his injuries early in the year, his performances in 2008 saw him again voted runner-up for the Ballon d\\'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, both times behind Cristiano Ronaldo.[75][84]\\n\\n Messi aiming to shoot during the 2009 UEFA Champions League Final against Manchester United\\nIn his first uninterrupted campaign, the 2008–09 season, he scored 38 goals in 51 games, contributing alongside Eto\\'o and winger Thierry Henry to a total of 100 goals in all competitions, a record at the time for the club.[85][86] During his first season under Barcelona\\'s new manager, former captain Pep Guardiola, Messi played mainly on the right wing, like he had under Rijkaard, though this time as a false winger with the freedom to cut inside and roam the centre. During the Clásico on 2 May 2009, however, he played for the first time as a false nine, positioned as a centre-forward but dropping deep into midfield to link up with Xavi and Andrés Iniesta. He set up his side\\'s first goal and scored twice to end the match in an emphatic 6–2 victory, the team\\'s greatest-ever score at Real Madrid\\'s Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.[87][88] Returning to the wing, he played his first final since breaking into the first team on 13 May, scoring once and assisting a second goal as Barcelona defeated Athletic Bilbao 4–1 to win the Copa del Rey.[89] With 23 league goals from Messi that season, Barcelona became La Liga champions three days later and achieved its fifth double.[85][90]\\nAs the season\\'s Champions League top scorer with nine goals, the youngest in the tournament\\'s history,[91] Messi scored two goals and assisted two more to ensure a 4–0 quarter-final victory over Bayern Munich.[87] He returned as a false nine during the final on 27 May in Rome against Manchester United. Barcelona were crowned champions of Europe by winning the match 2–0, the second goal coming from a Messi header over goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar. Barcelona thus achieved the first treble in the history of Spanish football.[92] This success was reflected in a new contract, signed on 18 September, which committed Messi to the club through 2016 with a new buyout clause of €250\\xa0million, while his salary increased to €12\\xa0million.[81]\\n\\n2009–10: First Ballon d\\'Or\\nHis team\\'s prosperity continued into the second half of 2009, as Barcelona became the first club to achieve the sextuple, winning six top-tier trophies in a single year.[93] After victories in the Supercopa de España and UEFA Super Cup in August, Barcelona won the FIFA Club World Cup against Estudiantes de La Plata on 19 December, with Messi scoring the winning 2–1 goal with his chest.[94] At 22 years old, Messi won the Ballon d\\'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, both times by the greatest voting margin in each trophy\\'s history.[75]\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Messi is the best player in the world by some distance. He\\'s like a PlayStation. He can take advantage of every mistake we make.\"\\n\\n\\n– Arsène Wenger commends Messi for his four-goal display against Arsenal in April 2010.[95]\\n\\n\\nThe new year, however, started on a less positive note for Barcelona, as they were knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Sevilla in the Round of 16.[96] Unsatisfied with his position on the right wing – with the club\\'s summer acquisition Zlatan Ibrahimović occupying the central forward role – Messi resumed playing as a false nine in early 2010, beginning with a Champions League last 16-round match against VfB Stuttgart. After a first-leg draw, Barcelona won the second leg 4–0 with two goals and an assist from Messi. At that point, he effectively became the tactical focal point of Guardiola\\'s team, and his goalscoring rate increased.[97] Messi scored a total of 47 goals in all competitions that season, equaling Ronaldo\\'s club record from the 1996–97 campaign.[98][99] He scored all of his side\\'s four goals in the Champions League quarter-final against Arsenal on 6 April while becoming Barcelona\\'s all-time top scorer in the competition.[100] Although Barcelona were eliminated in the Champions League semi-finals by the eventual champions, Inter Milan, Messi finished the season as top scorer (with 8 goals) for the second consecutive year.[101] As the league\\'s top scorer with 34 goals (again tying Ronaldo\\'s record), he helped Barcelona win a second consecutive La Liga trophy with only a single defeat and earned his first European Golden Shoe.[99][102]\\n\\n2010–11: Fifth La Liga title and third Champions League\\nMessi secured Barcelona\\'s first trophy of the 2010–11 campaign, the Supercopa de España, by scoring a hat-trick in his side\\'s second-leg 4–0 victory over Sevilla, after a first-leg defeat.[103] Assuming a playmaking role, he was again instrumental in a Clásico on 29 November 2010, the first with José Mourinho in charge of Real Madrid, as Barcelona defeated their rivals 5–0.[104] Messi helped the team achieve 16 consecutive league victories, a record in Spanish football, concluding with another hat-trick against Atlético Madrid on 5 February 2011.[105][106] His club performances in 2010 earned him the inaugural FIFA Ballon d\\'Or, an amalgamation of the Ballon d\\'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, though his win was met with some criticism due to his lack of success with Argentina at the 2010 FIFA World Cup.[75][107] Under the award\\'s old format, he would have placed just outside the top three, owing his win to the votes from the international coaches and captains.[107]\\nTowards the end of the season, Barcelona played four Clásicos in the span of 18 days. A league match on 16 April ended in a draw after a penalty from Messi. After Barcelona lost the Copa del Rey final four days later, Messi scored both goals in his side\\'s 2–0 win in the first leg of the Champions League semi-finals in Madrid, the second of which – a slaloming dribble past three Real players – was acclaimed as one of the best ever in the competition.[108] Although he did not score, he was again important in the second-leg draw that sent Barcelona through to the Champions League final,[109][110] where they faced Manchester United in a repeat of the final two years earlier. As the competition\\'s top scorer for the third consecutive year, with 12 goals, Messi gave a man-of-the-match performance at Wembley on 28 May, scoring the match-winning goal of Barça\\'s 3–1 victory.[111][112] Barcelona won a third consecutive La Liga title. In addition to his 31 goals, Messi was also the league\\'s top assist provider with 18.[113][114] He finished the season with 53 goals and 24 assists in all competitions, becoming Barcelona\\'s all-time single-season top scorer and the first player in Spanish football to reach the 50-goal benchmark.[113][115]\\n\\n Messi (centre) and his teammates celebrating winning the 2011 FIFA Club World Cup\\nAs Messi developed into a combination of a number 8 (a creator), a 9 (scorer), and a 10 (assistant),[116] he scored an unprecedented 73 goals and provided 29 assists in all club competitions during the 2011–12 season, producing a hat-trick or more on 10 occasions.[117][118][119] He began the campaign by helping Barcelona win both the Spanish and European Super Cups; in the Supercopa de España, he scored three times to achieve a 5–4 aggregate victory over Real Madrid, overtaking Raúl as the competition\\'s all-time top scorer with eight goals.[120][121] At the close of the year, on 18 December, he scored twice in the FIFA Club World Cup final, a 4–0 victory over Santos, earning the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament, as he had done two years previously.[122] For his efforts in 2011, he again received the FIFA Ballon d\\'Or, becoming only the fourth player in history to win the Ballon d\\'Or three times, after Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini, and Marco van Basten.[123] Additionally, he won the inaugural UEFA Best Player in Europe Award, a revival of the old-style Ballon d\\'Or.[124] By then, Messi was already widely considered one of the best footballers in history, alongside players like Diego Maradona and Pelé.[24]\\n\\n2012: A record-breaking year\\n\\n\\n\"I feel sorry for those who want to compete for Messi\\'s throne – it\\'s impossible, this kid is unique.\"\\n\\n\\n– Pep Guardiola after Messi became Barcelona\\'s all-time top scorer at age 24 in March 2012[125]\\n\\n\\nAs Messi maintained his goalscoring form into the second half of the season, the year 2012 saw him break several longstanding records. On 7 March, two weeks after scoring four goals in a league fixture against Valencia, he scored five times in a Champions League last 16-round match against Bayer Leverkusen, an unprecedented achievement in the history of the competition.[126][127] In addition to being the joint top assist provider with five assists, this feat made him top scorer with 14 goals, tying José Altafini\\'s record from the 1962–63 season, as well as becoming only the second player after Gerd Müller to be top scorer in four campaigns.[128][129] Two weeks later, on 20 March, Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona\\'s history at 24 years old, overtaking the 57-year record of César Rodríguez\\'s 232 goals with a hat-trick against Granada.[130]\\n\\n Messi pointing to the sky following his record five-goal display against Bayer Leverkusen in the last 16 of the UEFA Champions League in 2012\\nDespite Messi\\'s individual form, Barcelona\\'s four-year cycle of success under Guardiola – one of the greatest eras in the club\\'s history – drew to an end.[131] Although Barcelona won the Copa del Rey against Athletic Bilbao on 25 May, its 14th title of that period, the team lost the league to Real Madrid and was eliminated in the Champions League semi-finals by the eventual champions, Chelsea, with Messi sending a crucial second-leg penalty kick against the crossbar.[132][133] In Barça\\'s last home league match on 5 May, against Espanyol, Messi scored all four goals before approaching the bench to embrace Guardiola, who had announced his resignation as manager.[134] He finished the season as league top scorer in Spain and Europe for a second time, with 50 goals, a La Liga record, while his 73 goals in all competitions surpassed Gerd Müller\\'s 67 goals in the 1972–73 Bundesliga season, making him the single-season top scorer in the history of European club football.[135][136]\\nUnder manager Tito Vilanova, who had first coached him aged 14 at La Masia, Messi helped the club achieve its best-ever start to a La Liga season during the second half of 2012, amassing 55 points by the competition\\'s midway point, a record in Spanish football.[137] A double scored on 9 December against Real Betis saw Messi break two longstanding records: he surpassed César Rodríguez\\'s record of 190 league goals, becoming Barcelona\\'s all-time top scorer in La Liga, and Gerd Müller\\'s record of most goals scored in a calendar year, overtaking his 85 goals scored in 1972 for Bayern Munich and West Germany.[138] Messi sent Müller a number 10 Barcelona shirt, signed \"with respect and admiration\", after breaking his 40-year record.[139] At the close of the year, Messi had scored a record 91 goals in all competitions for Barcelona and Argentina.[140] Although FIFA did not acknowledge the achievement, citing verifiability issues, he received the Guinness World Records title for most goals scored in a calendar year.[141][142] As the odds-on favourite, Messi again won the FIFA Ballon d\\'Or, becoming the only player in history to win the Ballon d\\'Or four times.[140][143]\\n\\n2013–14: Messidependencia\\nBarcelona had virtually secured their La Liga title by the start of 2013, eventually equalling Real Madrid\\'s 100-point record of the previous season. However, their performances deteriorated in the second half of the 2012–13 campaign, concurrently with Vilanova\\'s absence due to ill health.[144] After losing successive Clásicos, including the Copa del Rey semi-finals, they were nearly eliminated in the first knockout round of the Champions League by AC Milan, but a revival of form in the second leg led to a 4–0 comeback, with two goals and an assist from Messi.[145] Now in his ninth senior season with Barcelona, Messi signed a new contract on 7 February, committing himself to the club through 2018, while his fixed wage rose to €13\\xa0million.[146][147] He wore the captain\\'s armband for the first time a month later, on 17 March, in a league match against Rayo Vallecano; by then, he had become the team\\'s tactical focal point to a degree that was arguably rivalled only by former Barcelona players Josep Samitier, László Kubala and Johan Cruyff.[148] Since his evolution into a false nine three years earlier, his input into the team\\'s attack had increased; from 24% in their treble-winning campaign, his goal contribution rose to more than 40% that season.[149]\\n\\n\\n\\n\"In Leo we are talking about the best player in the world and when things are not going well you have to use him.

After he suffered a hamstring strain on 2 April, during the first quarter-final against Paris Saint-Germain, his appearances became sporadic. In the second leg against PSG, with an underperforming Barcelona down a goal, Messi came off the bench in the second half and within nine minutes helped create their game-tying goal, which allowed them to progress to the semi-finals. Still unfit, he proved ineffective during the first leg against Bayern Munich and was unable to play at all during the second, as Barcelona were defeated 7–0 on aggregate by the eventual champions.[151] These matches gave credence to the notion of Messidependencia, Barcelona\\'s perceived tactical and psychological dependence on their star player.[151]\\n\\n Messi during a game against Almería in 2014\\nMessi continued to struggle with injury throughout 2013, eventually parting ways with his long-time personal physiotherapist.[152] Further damage to his hamstring sustained on 12 May ended his goalscoring streak of 21 consecutive league games, a worldwide record; he had netted 33 goals during his run, including a four-goal display against Osasuna, while becoming the first player to score consecutively against all 19 opposition teams in La Liga.[153][154] With 60 goals in all competitions, including 46 goals in La Liga, he finished the campaign as league top scorer in Spain and Europe for the second consecutive year, becoming the first player in history to win the European Golden Shoe three times.[155][156] Following an irregular start to the new season under manager Gerardo Martino, formerly of his boyhood club Newell\\'s Old Boys, Messi suffered his fifth injury of 2013 when he tore his hamstring on 10 November, leaving him sidelined for two months.[157][158] Despite his injuries, he was voted runner-up for the FIFA Ballon d\\'Or, relinquishing the award after a four-year monopoly to Cristiano Ronaldo.[159]\\nDuring the second half of the 2013–14 season, doubts persisted over Messi\\'s form, leading to a perception among the culés that he was reserving himself for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Statistically, his contribution of goals, shots, and passes had dropped significantly compared to previous seasons.[160][161] He still managed to break two longstanding records in a span of seven days: a hat-trick on 16 March against Osasuna saw him overtake Paulino Alcántara\\'s 369 goals to become Barcelona\\'s top goalscorer in all competitions including friendlies, while another hat-trick against Real Madrid on 23 March made him the all-time top scorer in El Clásico, ahead of the 18 goals scored by former Real Madrid player Alfredo Di Stéfano.[160][162] Messi finished the campaign with his worst output in five seasons, though he still managed to score 41 goals in all competitions.[161][163] For the first time in five years, Barcelona ended the season without a major trophy; they were defeated in the Copa del Rey final by Real Madrid and lost the league in the last game to Atlético Madrid, causing Messi to be booed by sections of fans at the Camp Nou.[164] After prolonged speculation over his future with the club, Messi signed a new contract on 19 May 2014, only a year after his last contractual update; his salary increased to €20\\xa0million, or €36\\xa0million before taxes, the highest wage in the sport.[165] It was reported that Vilanova played a key role in convincing Messi to stay[166] amid strong interest from Mourinho\\'s Chelsea.[167]\\n\\n2014–15: Second treble\\n Messi celebrating his second goal against Granada in 2014\\nUnder new manager and former captain Luis Enrique, Messi experienced a largely injury-free start to the 2014–15 season, allowing him to break three more longstanding records towards the end of the year.[168] A hat-trick scored against Sevilla on 22 November made him the all-time top scorer in La Liga, as he surpassed the 59-year record of 251 league goals held by Telmo Zarra.[169] A third hat-trick, scored against city rivals Espanyol on 7 December, allowed him to surpass César Rodríguez as the all-time top scorer in the Derbi barceloní with 12 goals.[170] Messi again placed second in the FIFA Ballon d\\'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo, largely owing to his second-place achievement with Argentina at the World Cup.[171]\\nAt the start of 2015, Barcelona were perceived to be headed for another disappointing end to the season, with renewed speculation in the media that Messi was leaving the club. A turning point came on 11 January during a 3–1 victory over Atlético Madrid, the first time Barça\\'s attacking trident of Messi, Luis Suárez and Neymar, dubbed \"MSN\", each scored in a match, marking the beginning of a highly successful run.[172][173] After five years of playing in the centre of the pitch, Messi had returned to his old position on the right wing late the previous year, by his own suggestion according to Suárez, their striker.[173][174] From there, he regained his best – arguably his best-ever – form, while Suárez and Neymar ended the team\\'s attacking dependency on their star player.[175][176] With 58 goals from Messi, the trio scored a total of 122 goals in all competitions that season, a record in Spanish football.[177]\\n\\n Messi dribbling past Juventus defender Patrice Evra during the 2015 UEFA Champions League Final\\nTowards the end of the campaign, Messi scored in a 1–0 away win over Atlético Madrid on 17 May, securing the La Liga title.[178] Among his 43 league goals that season was a hat-trick scored in 11 minutes against Rayo Vallecano on 8 March, the fastest of his senior career; it was his 32nd hat-trick overall for Barcelona, allowing him to overtake Telmo Zarra with the most hat-tricks in Spanish football.[179] As the season\\'s top assist provider with 18 he surpassed Luís Figo with the most assists in La Liga;[note 3] he made his record 106th assist in a fixture against Levante on 15 February, in which he also scored a hat-trick.[180][181][182] Messi scored twice as Barcelona defeated Athletic Bilbao 3–1 in the Copa del Rey final on 30 May, achieving the sixth double in their history. His opening goal was hailed as one of the greatest in his career; he collected the ball near the halfway line and beat four opposing players, before feinting the goalkeeper to score in a tight space by the near post.[183]\\nIn the Champions League, Messi scored twice and set up another in their 3–0 semi-final victory over Bayern Munich, now under the stewardship of Guardiola.[184] His second goal, which came only three minutes after his first, saw him chip the ball over goalkeeper Manuel Neuer after his dribble past Jérôme Boateng had made the defender drop to the ground; it went viral, becoming the year\\'s most tweeted about sporting moment, and was named the best goal of the season by UEFA.[185][186] Despite a second-leg loss, Barcelona progressed to the final on 6 June in Berlin, where they defeated Juventus 3–1 to win their second treble, becoming the first team in history to do so.[187][188] Although Messi did not score, he participated in each of his side\\'s goals, particularly the second as he forced a parried save from goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon from which Suárez scored the match-winning goal on the rebound.[177] In addition to being the top assist provider with six assists, Messi finished the competition as the joint top scorer with ten goals, which earned him the distinction of being the first player ever to achieve the top scoring mark in five Champions League seasons.[189][190] For his efforts during the season, he received the UEFA Best Player in Europe award for a second time.[191]\\n\\n2015–16: Domestic success\\n Messi holding off Sevilla\\'s Éver Banega during the 2015 UEFA Super Cup\\nMessi opened the 2015–16 season by scoring twice from free kicks in Barcelona\\'s 5–4 victory (after extra time) over Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup.[192] On 16 September, he became the youngest player to make 100 appearances in the UEFA Champions League in a 1–1 away draw to Roma.[193] After a knee injury, he returned to the pitch on 21 November, making a substitute appearance in Barcelona\\'s 4–0 away win over rivals Real Madrid in El Clásico.[194] Messi capped off the year by winning the 2015 FIFA Club World Cup Final on 20 December, collecting his fifth club trophy of 2015 as Barcelona defeated River Plate 3–0 in Yokohama.[195] On 30 December, Messi scored on his 500th appearance for Barcelona, in a 4–0 home win over Real Betis.[196]\\nOn 11 January 2016, Messi won the FIFA Ballon d\\'Or for a record fifth time in his career.[197] On 3 February, he scored a hat-trick in Barcelona\\'s 7–0 win against Valencia in the first leg of the Copa del Rey semi-final at the Camp Nou.[198] In a 6–1 home win against Celta Vigo in the league, Messi assisted Suárez from a penalty kick. Some saw it as \"a touch of genius\", while others criticised it as being disrespectful to the opponent. The Celta players never complained and their coach defended the penalty, stating, \"Barca\\'s forwards are very respectful.\" The penalty routine has been compared to that of Barça icon Johan Cruyff in 1982, who was battling lung cancer, leading many fans to indicate that the penalty was a tribute to him. Cruyff himself was \"very happy\" with the play, insisting \"it was legal and entertaining\".[199][200]\\nOn 17 February, Messi reached his 300th league goal in a 1–3 away win against Sporting de Gijón.[201] A few days later, he scored both goals in Barcelona\\'s 0–2 win against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium, in the first leg of the 2015–16 UEFA Champions League round of 16, with the second goal being Barcelona\\'s 10,000th in official competitions.[202] On 17 April, Messi ended a five-match scoring drought with his 500th senior career goal for club and country in Barcelona\\'s 2–1 home loss to Valencia.[203] Messi finished the 2015–16 season by setting up both goals in Barcelona\\'s 2–0 extra time win over Sevilla in the 2016 Copa del Rey Final, at the Vicente Calderón Stadium, on 22 May 2016, as the club celebrated winning the domestic double for the second consecutive season.[204] In total, Messi scored 41 goals and provided 23 assists, as Barcelona\\'s attacking trio managed a Spanish record of 131 goals throughout the season, breaking the record they had set the previous season.[205]\\n\\n2016–17: Fourth Golden Boot\\n\\n\\n\"[Messi] is indispensable, but the rest of us are dispensable. – No, the club is bigger than any manager, than any player... except Leo.

Dortmund were the 34th team he had scored against in the competition, breaking the previous record of 33 held by Cristiano Ronaldo and Raúl.[275] On 2 December, Messi was awarded a record-breaking sixth Ballon d\\'Or.[276] On 8 December, Messi scored his record-breaking 35th hat-trick in La Liga with three goals in Barcelona\\'s 5–2 home win over Mallorca.[277]\\nOn 22 February 2020, Messi scored four goals in a 5–0 home win over Eibar in La Liga.[278] On 14 June, he scored in a 4–0 away win against Mallorca, becoming the first player ever in La Liga to score 20 goals or more in 12 consecutive seasons.[279] On 30 June, he scored a panenka in a 2–2 home draw against Atlético Madrid in La Liga, to reach his 700th goal in his senior career for Barcelona and Argentina.[280] On 11 July, Messi provided his 20th assist of the league season for Arturo Vidal in a 1–0 away win over Real Valladolid, equalling Xavi\\'s record of 20 assists in a single La Liga season from 2008 to 2009;[281][282] with 22 goals, he also became only the second player ever, after Thierry Henry in the 2002–03 FA Premier League season with Arsenal (24 goals and 20 assists), to record at least 20 goals and 20 assists in a single league season in one of Europe\\'s top–five leagues.[282][283] Following his brace in a 5–0 away win against Alavés in the final match of the season on 20 May, Messi finished the season as both the top–scorer and top assist provider in La Liga, with 25 goals and 21 assists respectively, which saw him win his record seventh Pichichi trophy, overtaking Zarra; however, Barcelona missed out on the league title to Real Madrid.[284] On 9 August, in the Champions League round of 16 second leg versus Napoli at the Camp Nou, Messi scored the second goal and earned a penalty which led to a third goal and led his side to a 3–1 home victory and qualified 4–2 on aggregate for the quarter-finals against Bayern Munich.[285] On 15 August, Messi suffered his worst defeat as a player as Bayern Munich beat Barcelona 8–2 in a one-off tie in Lisbon, leading to another disappointing exit from the Champions League.[286]\\n\\nAugust 2020: Desire to leave Barcelona\\n\\n\\n“I wasn\\'t happy and I wanted to leave. I have not been allowed this in any way and I will stay at the club so as not to get into a legal dispute. The management of the club led by Bartomeu is a disaster. My love for Barça will never change.\"\\n\\n\\n– Messi on reversing his decision to leave Barcelona in an interview with Goal on 4 September 2020.[287]\\n\\n\\nFollowing growing dissatisfaction with the direction of Barcelona on and off the field,[288] Barcelona announced that Messi sent the club \"a document expressing his desire to leave\" on 25 August 2020.[289] The announcement garnered a significant media response, including from current and former teammates (who supported Messi\\'s statement) and Catalan president Quim Torra.[290] On 26 August, Barcelona\\'s sporting director Ramon Planes iterated the club\\'s desire to \"build a team around the most important player in the world\"[291] and affirmed Messi will only be able to leave should a buyer pay his €700 million buyout clause; a reported early termination option available in Messi\\'s contract (which would have allowed him to leave the club for free) could only be exercised if he had communicated his decision to Barcelona by 31 May 2020, although the player\\'s representatives argued the deadline should be set to 31 August, due to the adjourned 2019–20 season.[292] On 30 August, La Liga issued a statement stating Messi\\'s contract and buyout clause are still active.[293]\\nOn 4 September, Jorge Messi, Lionel\\'s father and agent, released a statement in response to La Liga claiming the release clause \"is not valid when the termination of the contract is by the player\\'s unilateral decision from the end of the 2019–20 season\", as stated in Messi\\'s contract with Barcelona;[294] moments later, La Liga issued a response reiterating their statement published on 30 August.[295] Later that evening, Messi announced in an interview with Goal that he would continue at Barcelona for the final year of his contract. In the interview, Messi claimed to have informed Barcelona of his desire to leave multiple times, and club president Josep Maria Bartomeu said Messi could decide at the end of every season if he wanted to stay or leave, only for Bartomeu to refer to the release clause.[296] This left Messi with two options: to stay or go to court against the club, with the player saying \"I would never go to court against the club of my life\".[297]\\n\\n2020–21: Final season at Barcelona\\nOn 27 September, Messi began the 2020–21 season by scoring a penalty in a 4–0 home win against Villarreal in La Liga.[298] Two days prior to the opening game, he again criticised the club, this time for the manner of Luis Suárez\\'s departure, stating, \"at this stage nothing surprises me any more\".[299] On 20 October, Messi scored a penalty in a 5–1 home victory against Ferencváros in the Champions League, becoming the first player in history to score in sixteen consecutive Champions League seasons.[300] On 25 November, Messi was nominated for the 2020 Best FIFA Men\\'s Player award, and was later shortlisted as one of the final three candidates.[301][302] On 29 November, Messi scored his side\\'s fourth goal in their 4–0 victory over Osasuna. After scoring, he unveiled a shirt of his former side Newell\\'s Old Boys, in tribute to Argentine compatriot Diego Maradona, who had died four days earlier, and raised both hands to the screen showing Maradona\\'s face in the stadium. The shirt was a number 10 replica of the same one Maradona had worn during his stint with the club in 1993.[303] On 17 December, Messi finished third in The Best FIFA Men\\'s Player award behind Robert Lewandowski and Cristiano Ronaldo, and was included in the FIFA FIFPro World XI for the fourteenth consecutive year.[304]\\nOn 23 December, Messi scored his 644th goal for Barcelona against Real Valladolid in La Liga, surpassing Pelé with Santos as the player with the most goals scored for a single club.[305][306] In order to celebrate his achievement, Budweiser sent personalised bottles of beer to every goalkeeper whom Messi has scored against.[307] On 17 January 2021, Messi was sent off for the first time in his club career for violent conduct (swinging an arm at the head of Asier Villalibre, missed initially by the referee but reviewed via VAR) in the final minutes of Barcelona\\'s 2–3 extra time defeat to Athletic Bilbao in the 2020–21 Supercopa de España Final.[308] On 10 March, Messi scored from 35 yards out and later had a penalty saved in a 1–1 draw against Paris Saint-Germain at the Parc des Princes in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16 as Barcelona were eliminated at this stage for the first time in 14 years by an aggregate score of 2–5 after having lost 1–4 at home on 16 February, with Messi scoring Barcelona\\'s only goal in that game.[309] On 15 March, Messi scored two goals in a 4–1 win against Huesca. With the first goal, he became the first player in football history to score at least 20 goals in 13 consecutive seasons in the top five European leagues.[310] On 21 March, he surpassed Xavi\\'s record to reach a club record of 768 appearances, in which he also scored a brace in a 6–1 away win against Real Sociedad.[311] On 17 April, Messi scored twice as Barcelona defeated Athletic Bilbao 4–0 in the 2021 Copa del Rey Final. With his second goal, he broke Gerd Müller\\'s record of 30 plus goals in 12 consecutive club seasons, setting a new record of 13. With his 35th trophy with Barcelona, Messi also overtook former Manchester United winger Ryan Giggs as the most decorated footballer for a single club.[312][313] On 16 May, Messi scored his 30th league goal of the campaign in a 1–2 home defeat against Celta Vigo, which later turned out to be his final goal and match in a Barcelona shirt.[314]\\nThe top goalscorer in La Liga, Messi was announced as the winner of the Pichichi trophy for a record eighth time in his career.[315] It was also his record fifth consecutive win in La Liga, surpassing Alfredo Di Stéfano and Hugo Sánchez who both had four for Real Madrid,[315] and equalled former Marseille striker Jean-Pierre Papin\\'s record of five consecutive league top scorer awards in the top five leagues of Europe.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Leo wanted to stay and the Club wanted him to stay but with the La Liga rules it has not been possible. To comply with the league\\'s fair play regulations we had to accept an agreement that mortgaged the Club\\'s TV right for half a century and FC Barcelona is above everything else.\"\\n\\n\\n– Barcelona president Joan Laporta explains the reason behind Messi\\'s departure.[316]\\n\\n\\nOn 1 July, Messi became a free agent after his contract expired,[317] with negotiations on a new deal complicated due to financial issues at Barcelona.[318] On 5 August, Barcelona announced that Messi would not be staying at the club, even though both parties reached an agreement and were due to sign a contract that day. The club cited financial and structural obstacles posed by La Liga regulations as a reason for Messi\\'s departure.[319] Club president Joan Laporta also blamed the previous board for Messi\\'s exit by saying \"the basis of everything is the calamitous and disastrous situation left by the previous board\", he added by saying \"the expected debt is much higher and we had some sports contracts in place that meant we had no margin on salary\".[320] Three days later, in a tearful press conference held at the Camp Nou, Messi confirmed that he would be leaving Barcelona.[321]\\n\\nParis Saint-Germain\\n2021–22: Seventh Ballon d\\'Or\\n Messi playing for Paris Saint-Germain in 2021\\nOn 10 August, Messi joined French club Paris Saint-Germain.[322] He signed a two-year deal until June 2023 with an option for an extra year.[323] Messi chose 30 as his squad number, the same he wore as a teenager when he made his senior debut for Barcelona.[324]\\nMessi made his debut for the club on 29 August, coming on as a substitute in the second half of a 2–0 away win over Reims in Ligue 1.[325] He made his first start and UEFA Champions League debut for the club in a 1–1 away draw against Club Brugge on 15 September.[326] Four days later, Messi made his home debut for PSG in a 2–1 win over Lyon.[327] On 28 September, he scored his first goal for the club, a strike from the edge of the 18-yard box after playing a one-two with Kylian Mbappé, in a 2–0 Champions League group stage win over Pep Guardiola\\'s Manchester City.[328] On 21 November, Messi scored his first Ligue 1 goal in a 3–1 home victory over Nantes.[329] On 28 November, he provided a hat-trick of assists for the fifth time in his career as PSG beat Saint-Étienne 3–1 away from home.[330]\\nHaving scored 40 goals at club and international level for the calendar year and helped Argentina win the 2021 Copa América, Messi received a record seventh Ballon d\\'Or on 29 November.[331]\\nOn 23 April 2022, Messi helped PSG clinch their 10th Ligue 1 title after scoring from a strike outside the 18-yard box in a 1–1 draw against Lens at the Parc des Princes.[332]\\n\\nInternational career\\n2004–05: Success at youth level\\nAs a dual Argentine-Spanish national, Messi was eligible to play for the national team of both countries.[333] Selectors for Spain\\'s Under-17 squad began pursuing him in 2003 after Barcelona\\'s director of football, Carles Rexach, alerted the Royal Spanish Football Federation to their young player. Messi declined the offer, having aspired to represent La Albiceleste since childhood. To further prevent Spain from taking him, the Argentine Football Association organised two under-20 friendlies in June 2004, against Paraguay and Uruguay, with the purpose of finalising his status as an Argentina player in FIFA. Five days after his 17th birthday, on 29 June, he made his debut for his country against Paraguay, scoring once and providing two assists in their 8–0 victory. He was subsequently included in the squad for the South American Youth Championship, held in Colombia in February 2005. As he lacked the stamina of his teammates, the result of his former growth hormone deficiency, he was used as a substitute in six of the nine games. After being named man of the match against Venezuela, he scored the winning 2–1 goal in the crucial last match against Brazil, thereby securing their third-place qualification for the FIFA World Youth Championship.[334]\\nAware of his physical limitations, Messi employed a personal trainer to increase his muscle mass, returning to the squad in an improved condition in time for the World Youth Championship, hosted by the Netherlands in June. After he was left out of the starting line-up in their first match against the United States, a 1–0 defeat, the squad\\'s senior players asked manager Francisco Ferraro to let Messi start, as they considered him their best player. After helping the team defeat Egypt and Germany to progress past the group stage, Messi proved decisive in the knockout phase as he scored their equaliser against Colombia, provided a goal and an assist against title favourites Spain, and scored their opening goal against reigning champions Brazil. Ahead of the final, he was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament. He scored two penalties in their 2–1 victory over Nigeria, clinching Argentina\\'s fifth championship and finishing the tournament as top scorer with 6 goals.[335][336] His performances drew comparisons with compatriot Diego Maradona, who had led Argentina to the title in 1979.[336]\\n\\n2005–06: Senior and World Cup debuts\\nIn recognition of his achievements with the under-20 side, senior manager José Pékerman gave Messi his first call-up for a friendly against Hungary on 17 August 2005. Aged 18, Messi made his senior debut for Argentina in the Ferenc Puskás Stadium when he came on in the 63rd minute, only to be sent off after two minutes for a perceived foul against Vilmos Vanczák, who had grabbed his shirt; Messi had struck the defender with his arm while trying to shake him off, which the referee interpreted as an intentional elbowing, a contentious decision.[337] Messi was reportedly found weeping in the dressing room after his sending-off.[338] He returned to the team on 3 September in their World Cup qualifier defeat to Paraguay, which he had declared his \"re-debut\" ahead of the match.[339] Messi started his first game in the next qualifying match against Peru, in which he was able to win a crucial penalty that secured their victory. After the match, Pékerman described him as \"a jewel\".[340] He subsequently made regular appearances for the team ahead of Argentina\\'s participation in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, scoring his first goal in a friendly against Croatia on 1 March 2006.[341] A hamstring injury sustained a week later jeopardised his presence in the World Cup, but he was nevertheless selected for Pékerman\\'s squad and regained fitness in time for the start of the tournament.[342]\\nDuring the World Cup in Germany, Messi witnessed their opening match victory against the Ivory Coast from the substitutes\\' bench. In the next match, against Serbia and Montenegro, he became the youngest player to represent Argentina at a FIFA World Cup when he came on as a substitute in the 74th minute. He assisted their fourth strike within minutes and scored the final goal in their 6–0 victory, making him the youngest scorer in the tournament and the sixth-youngest goalscorer in the history of the World Cup.[343] As their progression to the knockout phase was secured, several starters were rested during the last group match. Messi consequently started the game against the Netherlands, a 0–0 draw, as they won their group on goal differential.[344][345] In the round of 16 match against Mexico, played on his 19th birthday, Messi came on in the 84th minute, with the score tied at 1–1. He appeared to score a goal, but it was contentiously ruled offside, with the team needing a late goal in extra time to proceed.[346][347] He did not play in the quarter-final against Germany, during which Argentina were eliminated 4–2 in a penalty shootout.[348] Back home, Pékerman\\'s decision to leave him on the bench against Germany led to widespread criticism from those who believed Messi could have changed the outcome of the match in Argentina\\'s favour.[349][350]\\n\\n2007–08: Copa América final and Olympic gold\\n Messi evades Brazil\\'s Marcelo in the semi-final of the 2008 Summer Olympics\\nAs Messi evolved into one of the best players in the world, he secured a place in Alfio Basile\\'s starting line-up, as part of a team considered favourites to win the 2007 Copa América, held in Venezuela.[61][351] He set up the game-winning goal of their 4–1 victory over the United States in the opening match, before winning a penalty that led to the game-tying first strike of their 4–2 win in the next match against Colombia.[352][353] At the quarter-final stage, where the group winners faced Peru, he scored the second goal of a 4–0 victory that saw them through to the semi-final, during which he chipped the ball over Mexico\\'s goalkeeper to ensure another 3–0 win.[351] In a surprise defeat, Argentina lost the final 3–0 to a Brazil squad that lacked several of the nation\\'s best players.[354] Their unexpected loss was followed by much criticism in Argentina, though Messi was mostly exempt due to his young age and secondary status to star player Juan Román Riquelme.[351] He was named the best young player of the tournament by CONMEBOL.[355]\\nAhead of the 2008 Summer Olympics, Barcelona legally barred Messi from representing Argentina at the tournament as it coincided with their Champions League qualifying matches.[356] After interference from newly appointed Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola, who had won the tournament in 1992, Messi was permitted to join Sergio Batista\\'s under-23 squad in Beijing.[357] During the first match, he scored the opening goal in their 2–1 victory over the Ivory Coast. Following a 1–0 win in the next group match against Australia, ensuring their quarter-final qualification, Messi was rested during the game against Serbia, while his side won the match to finish first in their group. Against the Netherlands, he again scored the first goal and assisted a second strike to help his team to a 2–1 win in extra time. After a 3–0 semi-final victory over Brazil, Messi assisted the only goal in the final as Argentina defeated Nigeria to claim Olympic gold medals.[358] Along with Riquelme, Messi was singled out by FIFA as the stand-out player from the tournament\\'s best team.[359]\\n\\n2008–2011: Collective decline\\nFrom late 2008, the national team experienced a three-year period marked by poor performances.[351] Under manager Diego Maradona, who had led Argentina to World Cup victory as a player, the team struggled to qualify for the 2010 World Cup, securing their place in the tournament only after defeating Uruguay 1–0 in their last qualifying match. Maradona was criticised for his strategic decisions, which included playing Messi out of his usual position. In eight qualifying matches under Maradona\\'s stewardship, Messi scored only one goal, netting the opening goal in the first such match, a 4–0 victory over Venezuela.[341][360] During that game, played on 28 March 2009, he wore Argentina\\'s number 10 shirt for the first time, following the international retirement of Riquelme.[361] Overall, Messi scored four goals in 18 appearances during the qualifying process.[341] Ahead of the tournament, Maradona visited Messi in Barcelona to request his tactical input; Messi then outlined a 4–3–1–2 formation with himself playing behind the two strikers, a playmaking position known as the enganche in Argentine football, which had been his preferred position since childhood.[362]\\n\\n Messi in action during the opening match against Bolivia at the 2011 Copa América\\nDespite their poor qualifying campaign, Argentina were considered title contenders at the World Cup in South Africa. At the start of the tournament, the new formation proved effective; Messi managed at least four attempts on goal during their opening match but was repeatedly denied by Nigeria\\'s goalkeeper, resulting in a 1–0 win. During the next match, against South Korea, he excelled in his playmaking role, participating in all four goals of his side\\'s 4–1 victory. As their place in the knockout phase was guaranteed, most of the starters were rested during the last group match, but Messi reportedly refused to be benched.[360] He wore the captain\\'s armband for the first time in their 2–0 win against Greece; as the focal point of their play, he helped create their second goal to see Argentina finish as group winners.[363]\\nArgentina were eliminated in the quarter-final against Germany, at the same stage of the tournament and by the same opponent as four years earlier. Their 4–0 loss was their worst margin of defeat at a World Cup since 1974.[364] FIFA subsequently identified Messi as one of the tournament\\'s 10 best players, citing his \"outstanding\" pace and creativity and \"spectacular and efficient\" dribbling, shooting and passing.[365] Back home, however, Messi was the subject of harsher judgement. As the perceived best player in the world, he had been expected to lead an average team to the title, as Maradona arguably did in 1986, but he had failed to replicate his performances at Barcelona with the national team, leading to the accusation that he cared less about his country than his club.[366]\\nMaradona was replaced by Sergio Batista, who had orchestrated Argentina\\'s Olympic victory. Batista publicly stated that he intended to build the team around Messi, employing him as a false nine within a 4–3–3 system, as used to much success by Barcelona.[366][367] Although Messi scored a record 53 goals during the 2010–11 club season, he had not scored for Argentina in an official match since March 2009.[113][341] Despite the tactical change, his goal drought continued during the 2011 Copa América, hosted by Argentina. Their first two matches, against Bolivia and Colombia, ended in draws. Media and fans noted that he did not combine well with striker Carlos Tevez, who enjoyed greater popularity among the Argentine public; Messi was consequently booed by his own team\\'s supporters for the first time in his career. During the crucial next match, with Tevez on the bench, he gave a well-received performance, assisting two goals in their 3–0 victory over Costa Rica. After the quarter-final against Uruguay ended in a 1–1 draw following extra time, with Messi having assisted their equaliser, Argentina were eliminated 4–5 in the penalty shootout by the eventual champions.[366]\\n\\n2011–2013: Assuming the captaincy\\n Messi scored his first international hat-trick against Switzerland in 2012\\nAfter Argentina\\'s unsuccessful performance in the Copa América, Batista was replaced by Alejandro Sabella. Upon his appointment in August 2011, Sabella awarded the 24-year-old Messi the captaincy of the squad, in accord with then-captain Javier Mascherano. Reserved by nature, Messi went on to lead his squad by example as their best player, while Mascherano continued to fulfil the role of the team\\'s on-field leader and motivator.[368][369] In a further redesign of the team, Sabella dismissed Tevez and brought in players with whom Messi had won the World Youth Championship and Olympic Games. Now playing in a free role in an improving team, Messi ended his goal drought by scoring during their first World Cup qualifying match against Chile on 7 October, his first official goal for Argentina in two-and-a-half years.[341][368]\\nUnder Sabella, Messi\\'s goalscoring rate drastically increased; where he had scored only 17 goals in 61 matches under his previous managers, he scored 25 times in 32 appearances during the following three years.[341][368] He netted a total of 12 goals in 9 games for Argentina in 2012, equalling the record held by Gabriel Batistuta for the most goals scored in a calendar year for their country.[370] His first international hat-trick came in a friendly against Switzerland on 29 February 2012, followed by two more hat-tricks over the next year-and-a-half in friendlies against Brazil and Guatemala. Messi then helped the team secure their place in the 2014 World Cup with a 5–2 victory over Paraguay on 10 September 2013 when he scored twice from penalty kicks, taking his international tally to 37 goals to become Argentina\\'s second-highest goalscorer behind Batistuta. Overall, he had scored a total of 10 goals in 14 matches during the qualifying campaign.[341][371] Concurrently with his bettered performances, his relationship with his compatriots improved, as he gradually began to be perceived more favourably in Argentina.[368]\\n\\n2014–15: World Cup and Copa América finals\\n Messi watches his 25-yard curling strike hit the net against Iran to win the game for Argentina in their second group game at the 2014 FIFA World Cup\\nAhead of the World Cup in Brazil, doubts persisted over Messi\\'s form, as he finished an unsuccessful and injury-plagued season with Barcelona. At the start of the tournament, however, he gave strong performances, being elected man of the match in their first four matches.[372] In his first World Cup match as captain, he led them to a 2–1 victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina; he helped create Sead Kolašinac\\'s own goal and scored their second strike after a dribble past three players, his first World Cup goal since his debut in the tournament eight years earlier.[373] During the second match against Iran, he scored an injury-time goal from 25 yards out to end the game in a 1–0 win, securing their qualification for the knockout phase.[374] He scored twice in the last group match, a 3–2 victory over Nigeria, his second goal coming from a free kick, as they finished first in their group.[375] Messi assisted a late goal in extra time to ensure a 1–0 win against Switzerland in the round of 16, and played in the 1–0 quarter-final win against Belgium as Argentina progressed to the semi-final of the World Cup for the first time since 1990.[376][377] Following a 0–0 draw in extra time, they eliminated the Netherlands 4–2 in a penalty shootout to reach the final, with Messi scoring his team\\'s first penalty.[378]\\n\\n Messi battles Germany\\'s Mats Hummels for the ball during the 2014 FIFA World Cup Final\\nBilled as Messi versus Germany, the world\\'s best player against the best team, the final was a repeat of the 1990 final featuring Diego Maradona.[379] Within the first half-hour, Messi had started the play that led to a goal, but it was ruled offside. He missed several opportunities to open the scoring throughout the match, in particular at the start of the second half when his breakaway effort went wide of the far post. Substitute Mario Götze finally scored in the 113th minute, followed in the last minute of extra time by a free kick that Messi sent over the net, as Germany won the match 1–0 to claim the World Cup.[380] At the conclusion of the final, Messi was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament. In addition to being the joint third-highest goalscorer, with four goals and an assist, he created the most chances, completed the most dribbling runs, made the most deliveries into the penalty area and produced the most throughballs in the competition.[372][381] However, his selection drew criticism due to his lack of goals in the knockout round; FIFA President Sepp Blatter expressed his surprise, while Maradona suggested that Messi had undeservedly been chosen for marketing purposes.[382]\\nAnother final appearance, the third of Messi\\'s senior international career, followed in the 2015 Copa América, held in Chile. Under the stewardship of former Barcelona manager Gerardo Martino, Argentina entered the tournament as title contenders due to their second-place achievement at the World Cup.[383][384] During the opening match against Paraguay, they were ahead two goals by half-time but lost their lead to end the match in a 2–2 draw; Messi had scored from a penalty kick, netting his only goal in the tournament.[385] Following a 1–0 win against defending champions Uruguay, Messi earned his 100th cap for his country in the final group match, a 1–0 win over Jamaica, becoming only the fifth Argentine to achieve this milestone.[386] In his 100 appearances, he had scored a total of 46 goals for Argentina, 22 of which came in official competitive matches.[341][386]\\nAs Messi evolved from the team\\'s symbolic captain into a genuine leader, he led Argentina to the knockout stage as group winners.[387] In the quarter-final, they created numerous chances, including a rebound header by Messi, but were repeatedly denied by Colombia\\'s goalkeeper, and ultimately ended the match scoreless, leading to a 5–4 penalty shootout in their favour, with Messi netting his team\\'s first spot kick.[388] At the semi-final stage, Messi excelled as a playmaker as he provided three assists and helped create three more goals in his side\\'s 6–1 victory over Paraguay, receiving applause from the initially hostile crowd.[387] Argentina started the final as the odds-on title favourites, but were defeated by Chile 4–1 in a penalty shootout after an 0–0 extra-time draw. Faced with aggression from opposing players, including taking a boot to the midriff, Messi played below his standards, though he was the only Argentine to successfully convert his penalty.[389] At the close of the tournament, he was reportedly selected to receive the Most Valuable Player award but rejected the honour.[390] As Argentina continued a trophy drought that began in 1993, the World Cup and Copa América defeats again brought intense criticism for Messi from Argentine media and fans.[391]\\n\\n2016–17: Third Copa América final, retirement, and return\\nMessi\\'s place in Argentina\\'s Copa América Centenario squad was initially put in jeopardy when he sustained a back injury in a 1–0 friendly win over Honduras in a pre-Copa América warm-up match on 27 May 2016.[392] It was later reported that he had suffered a deep bruise in his lumbar region. He was later left on the bench in Argentina\\'s 2–1 opening win over defending champions Chile on 6 June due to concerns regarding his fitness.[393] Although Messi was declared match-fit for his nation\\'s second group match against Panama on 10 June, Martino left him on the bench once again; he replaced Augusto Fernández in the 61st minute and subsequently scored a hat-trick in 19 minutes, also starting the play which led to Sergio Agüero\\'s goal, as the match ended in a 5–0 victory, sealing Argentina\\'s place in the quarter-finals of the competition;[394] he was elected man of the match for his performance.[395]\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Did it annoy me that Messi took the record? A little, yes. You go around the world and people say, \\'he\\'s the top scorer for the Argentina national team.\\' But the advantage I have is that I\\'m second to an extraterrestrial.\"\\n\\n\\n– Gabriel Batistuta on the consolation of Messi breaking his record.[396]\\n\\n\\nOn 18 June, in the quarter-final of the Copa América against Venezuela, Messi produced another man of the match performance,[397] assisting two goals and scoring another in a 4–1 victory, which enabled him to equal Gabriel Batistuta\\'s national record of 54 goals in official international matches.[398] This record was broken three days later when Messi scored a free kick in a 4–0 semi-final win against hosts the United States; he also assisted two goals during the match as Argentina sealed a place in the final of the competition for a second consecutive year,[399] and was named man of the match once again.[400]\\nDuring a repeat of the previous year\\'s final on 26 June, Argentina once again lost to Chile on penalties after a 0–0 deadlock, resulting in Messi\\'s third consecutive defeat in a major tournament final with Argentina, and his fourth overall. After the match, Messi, who had missed his penalty in the shootout, announced his retirement from international football.[401] He stated, \"I tried my hardest. The team has ended for me, a decision made.\"[402] Chile coach Juan Antonio Pizzi said after the match, \"My generation can\\'t compare him to Maradona that\\'s for my generation, because of what Maradona did for Argentine football. But I think the best player ever played today here in the United States.\"[403] Messi finished the tournament as the second highest scorer, behind Eduardo Vargas, with five goals, and was the highest assist provider with four assists, also winning more Man of the Match awards than any other player in the tournament (3);[404] he was named to the team of the tournament for his performances, but missed out on the Golden Ball Award for best player, which went to Alexis Sánchez.[405]\\nFollowing his announcement, a campaign began in Argentina for Messi to change his mind about retiring.[406] He was greeted by fans with signs like \"Don\\'t go, Leo\" when the team landed in Buenos Aires. President of Argentina Mauricio Macri urged Messi not to quit, stating, \"We are lucky, it is one of life\\'s pleasures, it is a gift from God to have the best player in the world in a footballing country like ours... Lionel Messi is the greatest thing we have in Argentina and we must take care of him.\"[407] Mayor of Buenos Aires Horacio Rodríguez Larreta unveiled a statue of Messi in the capital to convince him to reconsider retirement.[408] The campaign also continued in the streets and avenues of the Argentine capital, with about 50,000 supporters going to the Obelisco de Buenos Aires on 2 July, using the same slogan.[409]\\n\\nReturn\\n\\n\\n\"A lot of things went through my mind on the night of the final and I gave serious thought to quitting, but my love for my country and this shirt is too great.\"\\n\\n\\n– Messi reversing his decision from retiring on 12 August 2016[410]\\n\\n\\nJust a week after Messi announced his international retirement, Argentine newspaper La Nación reported that he was reconsidering playing for Argentina at the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers in September.[411] On 12 August, it was confirmed that Messi had reversed his decision to retire from international football, and he was included in the squad for the national team\\'s upcoming 2018 World Cup qualifiers.[412] On 1 September, in his first game back, he scored in a 1–0 home win over Uruguay in a 2018 World Cup qualifier.[413]\\n\\n Messi celebrates his hat-trick against Ecuador in 2017 which saw Argentina qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup\\nOn 28 March 2017, Messi was suspended for four international games for insulting an assistant referee in a game against Chile on 23 March 2017. He was also fined CHF 10,000.[414][415] On 5 May, Messi\\'s four match ban as well as his 10,000 CHF fine was lifted by FIFA after Argentina Football Association appealed against his suspension, which meant he could now play Argentina\\'s remaining World Cup Qualifiers.[416] Argentina\\'s place in the 2018 World Cup was in jeopardy going into their final qualifying match as they were sixth in their group, outside the five possible CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying spots, meaning they risked failing to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1970. On 10 October, Messi led his country to World Cup qualification in scoring a hat-trick as Argentina came from behind to defeat Ecuador 3–1 away; Argentina had not defeated Ecuador in Quito since 2001.[417] Messi\\'s three goals saw him become the joint all-time leading scorer in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifiers with 21 goals, alongside Uruguay\\'s Luis Suárez, overtaking the previous record which was held by compatriot Hernán Crespo.[417]\\n\\n2018: World Cup\\n\\n\\n\"The squad is the worst in their history. Even having the best player in the world was not capable of creating a competitive team. All the decline of recent times was hidden by this unrivalled genius [Messi]\"\\n\\n\\n– Former Argentine player Osvaldo Ardiles on the decline in quality of Argentina being masked by Messi.[418]\\n\\n\\nFollowing on from their poor qualification campaign, expectations were not high going into the 2018 World Cup, with the team, without an injured Messi, losing 6–1 to Spain in March 2018.[419][420] Prior to Argentina\\'s opener, there was speculation in the media over whether this would be Messi\\'s final World Cup.[421] In the team\\'s opening group match against Iceland on 16 June, Messi missed a potential match-winning penalty in an eventual 1–1 draw.[422] In Argentina\\'s second game on 21 June, the team lost 3–0 to Croatia. Post-match the Argentina coach Jorge Sampaoli spoke of the lack of quality in the team surrounding Messi, saying \"we quite simply couldn\\'t pass to him to help him generate the situations he is used to. We worked to give him the ball but the opponent also worked hard to prevent him from getting the ball. We lost that battle\".[423] Croatia captain and midfielder Luka Modrić also stated post match, \"Messi is an incredible player but he can\\'t do everything alone.\"[424]\\n\\n Messi celebrates his goal against Nigeria at the 2018 FIFA World Cup\\nIn Argentina\\'s final group match against Nigeria at the Krestovsky Stadium, Saint Petersburg on 26 June, Messi scored the opening goal in an eventual 2–1 victory, becoming the third Argentine after Diego Maradona and Gabriel Batistuta to score in three different World Cups; he also became the first player to score in the World Cup in his teens, twenties, and his thirties.[425] A goal of the tournament contender, Messi received a long pass from midfield and controlled the ball on the run with two touches before striking it across goal into the net with his weaker right foot.[426][427] He was awarded Man of the Match.[428] Argentina progressed to the second round as group runners-up behind Croatia.[429] In the round of 16 match against eventual champions France on 30 June, Messi set up Gabriel Mercado\\'s and Sergio Agüero\\'s goals in a 3–4 defeat, which saw Argentina eliminated from the World Cup.[430] With his two assists in his team\\'s second round fixture, Messi became the first player to provide an assist in the last four World Cups, and also became the first player to provide two assists in a match for Argentina since Maradona had managed the same feat against South Korea in 1986.[431][432]\\nFollowing the tournament, Messi stated that he would not participate in Argentina\\'s friendlies against Guatemala and Colombia in September, and commented that it would be unlikely that he would represent his nation for the remainder of the calendar year. Messi\\'s absence from the national team and his continued failure to win a title with Argentina prompted speculation in the media that Messi might retire from international football once again.[433] In March 2019, however, he was called up to the Argentina squad once again for the team\\'s friendlies against Venezuela and Morocco later that month.[434] He made his international return on 22 March, in a 3–1 friendly defeat to Venezuela, in Madrid.[435]\\n\\n2019–20: Copa América third-place, suspension and Superclásico victory\\nOn 21 May, Messi was included in Lionel Scaloni\\'s final 23-man Argentina squad for the 2019 Copa América.[436] In Argentina\\'s second group match of the tournament on 19 June, Messi scored the equalising goal from the penalty spot in a 1–1 draw against Paraguay.[437] After coming under criticism in the media over his performance following Argentina\\'s 2–0 victory over Venezuela in the quarter-finals at the Maracanã Stadium on 28 June, Messi commented that it had not been his best Copa América, while also criticising the poor quality of the pitches.[438] Following Argentina\\'s 2–0 defeat to hosts Brazil in the semi-finals on 2 July, Messi was critical of the refereeing during the match,[439][440] and alleged the competition was \"setup\" for Brazil to win.[441]\\nIn the third-place match against Chile on 6 July, Messi set-up Agüero\\'s opening goal from a free kick in an eventual 2–1 win, to help Argentina capture the bronze medal; however, he was sent off along with Gary Medel in the 37th minute of play, after being involved in an altercation with the Chilean defender.[442] Following the match, Messi refused to collect his medal, and implied in a post-match interview that his comments following the semi-final led to his sending off.[443] Messi later issued an apology for his comments, but was fined $1,500 and was handed a one-match ban by CONMEBOL, which ruled him out of Argentina\\'s next World Cup qualifier.[444] On 2 August, Messi was banned for three months from international football and was fined $50,000 by CONMEBOL for his comments against the referee\\'s decisions; this ban meant he would miss Argentina\\'s friendly matches against Chile, Mexico and Germany in September and October.[445] On 15 November, Messi played in the 2019 Superclásico de las Américas versus Brazil, scoring the winning goal by a rebound of his saved penalty.[446] On 8 October 2020, Messi scored a penalty in a 1–0 victory against Ecuador, giving Argentina a winning start to their 2022 World Cup qualifying campaign.[447]\\n\\n2021: Appearance record, Copa América victory and South American top goalscorer\\n\\n\\n\"It was clear to me that I had to try until the last tournament and that I couldn\\'t withdraw from the national team without winning something.\"\\n\\n\\n– Messi on winning the 2021 Copa América in an interview with Diario SPORT.[448]\\n\\n\\nOn 14 June 2021, Messi scored from a free kick in a 1–1 draw against Chile in Argentina\\'s opening group match of the 2021 Copa América in Brazil.[449] On 21 June, Messi played in his 147th match as he equalled Javier Mascherano\\'s record for most appearances for Argentina in a 1–0 win over Paraguay in their third game of the tournament.[450] A week later, he broke the record for most appearances in an Argentina shirt when he featured in a 4–1 win against Bolivia in his team\\'s final group match, assisting Papu Gómez\\'s opening goal and later scoring two.[451] On 3 July, Messi assisted twice and scored from a free-kick in a 3–0 win over Ecuador in the quarter-finals of the competition.[452] On 6 July, in a 1–1 draw in the semi-finals against Colombia, Messi made his 150th appearance for his country and registered his fifth assist of the tournament, a cut-back for Lautaro Martínez, matching his record of nine goal contributions in a single tournament from five years earlier; he later netted his spot kick in Argentina\\'s eventual 3–2 penalty shoot-out victory to progress to his fifth international final.[453][454] On 10 July, Argentina defeated hosts Brazil 1–0 in the final, giving Messi his first major international title and Argentina\\'s first since 1993, as well as his nation\\'s joint record 15th Copa América overall.[455] Messi was directly involved in 9 out of the 12 goals scored by Argentina, scoring four and assisting five; he was named the player of the tournament for his performances, an honour he shared with Neymar. He also finished as the tournament\\'s top scorer with four goals tied with Colombia\\'s Luis Díaz, with the Golden Boot awarded to Messi as he had more assists.[456][457]\\nOn 9 September, Messi scored a hat-trick in a 3–0 home win over Bolivia in a 2022 World Cup qualifier which also moved him above Pelé as South America\\'s top male international scorer with 79 goals.[458]\\n\\nPlayer profile\\nStyle of play\\n A versatile forward, Messi often plays as a classic number 10.\\nDue to his short stature, Messi has a lower centre of gravity than taller players, which gives him greater agility, allowing him to change direction more quickly and evade opposing tackles;[459][460] this has led the Spanish media to dub him La Pulga Atómica (\"The Atomic Flea\").[461][462][463] Despite being physically unimposing, he possesses significant upper-body strength, which, combined with his low centre of gravity and resulting balance, aids him in withstanding physical challenges from opponents; he has consequently been noted for his lack of diving in a sport rife with playacting.[17][460][464] His short, strong legs allow him to excel in short bursts of acceleration while his quick feet enable him to retain control of the ball when dribbling at speed.[465] His former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola once stated, \"Messi is the only player that runs faster with the ball than he does without it.\"[46] Although he has improved his ability with his weaker foot since his mid-20s, Messi is predominantly a left-footed player; with the outside of his left foot, he usually begins dribbling runs, while he uses the inside of his foot to finish and provide passes and assists.[466][467]\\nA prolific goalscorer, Messi is known for his finishing, positioning, quick reactions, and ability to make attacking runs to beat the defensive line. He also functions in a playmaking role, courtesy of his vision and range of passing.[468] He has often been described as a magician; a conjurer, creating goals and opportunities where seemingly none exist.[469][470][471] Moreover, he is an accurate free kick and penalty kick taker.[460][472] As of August 2021, Messi ranks 11th all time in goals scored from direct free kicks with 58,[473] the most among active players.[474] He also has a penchant for scoring from chips.[475]\\n\\n Messi is known to drop deep, link-up with midfielders, orchestrate attacking plays, and create goal-scoring opportunities.\\nMessi\\'s pace and technical ability enable him to undertake individual dribbling runs towards goal, in particular during counterattacks, usually starting from the halfway line or the right side of the pitch.[464][472][476] Widely considered to be the best dribbler in the world,[477] and one of the greatest dribblers of all time,[478] with regard to this ability, his former Argentina manager Diego Maradona has said of him, \"The ball stays glued to his foot; I\\'ve seen great players in my career, but I\\'ve never seen anyone with Messi\\'s ball control.\"[467] Beyond his individual qualities, he is also a well-rounded, hard-working team player, known for his creative combinations, in particular with former Barcelona midfielders Xavi and Andrés Iniesta.[459][460]\\nTactically, Messi plays in a free attacking role; a versatile player, he is capable of attacking on either wing or through the centre of the pitch. His favoured position in childhood was the playmaker behind two strikers, known as the enganche in Argentine football, but he began his career in Spain as a left-winger or left-sided forward.[362] Upon his first-team debut, he was moved onto the right wing by manager Frank Rijkaard; from this position, he could more easily cut through the defence into the middle of the pitch and curl shots on goal with his left foot, rather than predominantly cross balls for teammates.[46] Under Guardiola and subsequent managers, he most often played in a false nine role; positioned as a centre-forward or lone striker, he would roam the centre, often moving deep into midfield and drawing defenders with him, in order to create and exploit spaces for passes, other teammates\\' attacking runs off the ball, Messi\\'s own dribbling runs, or combinations with Xavi and Iniesta.[24] Under the stewardship of Luis Enrique, Messi initially returned to playing in the right-sided position that characterised much of his early career in the manager\\'s 4–3–3 formation,[174][479] while he was increasingly deployed in a deeper, free playmaking role in later seasons.[480][481] Under manager Ernesto Valverde, Messi played in a variety of roles. While he occasionally continued to be deployed in a deeper role, from which he could make runs from behind into the box,[482] or even on the right wing[483] or as a false nine,[484][485] he was also used in a more offensive, central role in a 4–2–3–1,[481] or as a second striker in a 4–4–2 formation, where he was once again given the licence to drop deep, link-up with midfielders, orchestrate his teams attacking plays, and create chances for his attacking partner Suárez.[486][487]\\n\\n Messi prepares to shoot with his dominant left foot in the 2014 FIFA World Cup Final\\nAs his career advanced, and his tendency to dribble diminished slightly with age, Messi began to dictate play in deeper areas of the pitch and developed into one of the best passers and playmakers in football history.[488][489][490] His work-rate off the ball and defensive responsibilities also decreased as his career progressed; by covering less ground on the pitch, and instead conserving his energy for short bursts of speed, he was able to improve his efficiency, movement, and positional play, and was also able to avoid muscular injuries, despite often playing a large number of matches throughout a particular season on a consistent basis. Indeed, while he was injury-prone in his early career, he was later able to improve his injury record by running less off the ball, and by adopting a stricter diet, training regime, and sleep schedule.[491] With the Argentina national team, Messi has similarly played anywhere along the frontline; under various managers, he has been employed on the right wing, as a false nine, as an out-and-out striker, in a supporting role alongside another forward, or in a deeper, free creative role as a classic number 10 playmaker or attacking midfielder behind the strikers.[367][492]\\n\\nReception\\n\\n\\n\"I have seen the player who will inherit my place in Argentinian football and his name is Messi.\"\\n\\n\\n– Diego Maradona hailing the 18-year-old Messi as his successor in February 2006[68]\\n\\nA prodigious talent as a teenager, Messi established himself among the world\\'s best players before age 20.[61] Diego Maradona considered the 18-year-old Messi the best player in the world alongside Ronaldinho, while the Brazilian himself, shortly after winning the Ballon d\\'Or, commented, \"I\\'m not even the best at Barça\", in reference to his protégé.[493][494] Four years later, after Messi had won his first Ballon d\\'Or by a record margin,[75] the public debate regarding his qualities as a player moved beyond his status in contemporary football to the possibility that he was one of the greatest players in history.[13][464][495] An early proponent was his then-manager Pep Guardiola, who, as early as August 2009, declared Messi to be the best player he had ever seen.[496] In the following years, this opinion gained greater acceptance among pundits, managers, former and current players,[115][497] and by the end of Barça\\'s second treble-winning season, Messi\\'s superiority, ahead of Maradona and Pelé, had become the apparent view among many fans and pundits in continental Europe.[498][499] He initially received several dismissals by critics, based on the fact that he had not won an international trophy at senior level with Argentina,[500] until he won his first international trophy at the 2021 Copa América.[501]\\nArgentina fans with Messi and Maradona banners at the 2018 World Cup in RussiaThe Sistine Chapel of Football painting (Messi to the left, Maradona to the right), on the ceiling of a sports club, Sportivo Pereyra, in Barracas, Buenos Aires\\nThroughout his career, Messi has been compared with his late compatriot Diego Maradona, due to their similar playing styles as diminutive, left-footed dribblers. Initially, he was merely one of many young Argentine players, including his boyhood idol Pablo Aimar, to receive the \"New Maradona\" moniker, but as his career progressed, Messi proved his similarity beyond all previous contenders, establishing himself as the greatest player Argentina had produced since Maradona.[21][360] Jorge Valdano, who won the 1986 World Cup alongside Maradona, said in October 2013, \"Messi is Maradona every day. For the last five years, Messi has been the Maradona of the World Cup in Mexico.\"[502] César Menotti, who as manager orchestrated their 1978 World Cup victory, echoed this sentiment when he opined that Messi plays \"at the level of the best Maradona\".[503] Other notable Argentines in the sport, such as Osvaldo Ardiles, Javier Zanetti, and Diego Simeone, have expressed their belief that Messi has overtaken Maradona as the best player in history.[504][505][506]\\nIn Argentine society, Messi is generally held in lesser esteem than Maradona, a consequence of not only his perceived uneven performances with the national team, but also of differences in class, personality, and background. Messi is in some ways the antithesis of his predecessor: where Maradona was an extroverted, controversial character who rose to greatness from the slums, Messi is reserved and unassuming, an unremarkable man outside of football.[333][507][508] An enduring mark against him is the fact that, through no fault of his own, he never proved himself in the Argentine Primera División as an upcoming player, achieving stardom overseas from a young age,[17][333] while his lack of outward passion for the Albiceleste shirt (he does not sing the national anthem and is disinclined to emotional displays) have in the past led to the false perception that he felt Catalan rather than truly Argentine.[366] Despite having lived in Spain since age 13, Messi rejected the option of representing Spain internationally. He has said: \"Argentina is my country, my family, my way of expressing myself. I would change all my records to make the people in my country happy.\"[509] Moreover, several pundits and footballing figures, including Maradona, have also questioned Messi\\'s leadership with Argentina at times, despite his playing ability.[510][511][512]\\n\\nComparisons to Cristiano Ronaldo\\nMain article: Messi–Ronaldo rivalry\\n Messi has been compared to Cristiano Ronaldo (left) throughout much of their careers.\\nAmong his contemporary peers, Messi is most often compared and contrasted with Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo, as part of an ongoing rivalry that has been compared to past sports rivalries like the Muhammad Ali–Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Roger Federer–Rafael Nadal rivalry in tennis, and the Senna–Prost rivalry from Formula One motor racing.[513][514]\\nAlthough Messi has at times denied any rivalry,[515][516] they are widely believed to push one another in their aim to be the best player in the world:[160] since 2008, Messi has won seven Ballons d\\'Or to Ronaldo\\'s five,[517] six FIFA World\\'s Best Player awards to Ronaldo\\'s five, and six European Golden Shoes to Ronaldo\\'s four.[518] Pundits and fans regularly argue the individual merits of both players;[160][519] beyond their playing styles, the debate also revolves around their differing physiques – Ronaldo is 1.87\\xa0m (6\\xa0ft 1+1⁄2\\xa0in) with a muscular build – and contrasting public personalities, with Ronaldo\\'s self-confidence and theatrics a foil to Messi\\'s humility.[520][521][522] From 2009–10 to 2017–18, Messi faced Ronaldo at least twice every season in El Clásico, which ranks among the world\\'s most viewed annual sports events.[523] Off the pitch, Ronaldo is his direct competitor in terms of salary, sponsorships, and social media fanbase.[523]\\n\\nIn popular culture\\nAccording to France Football, Messi was the world\\'s highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014; he was the first player to exceed the €40\\xa0million benchmark, with earnings of €41\\xa0million in 2013, and the €50–€60\\xa0million points, with income of €65\\xa0million in 2014.[165][524] Messi was second on Forbes list of the world\\'s highest-paid athletes (after Cristiano Ronaldo) with income of $81.4\\xa0million from his salary and endorsements in 2015–16.[525] In 2018 he was the first player to exceed the €100m benchmark for a calendar year, with earnings of €126m ($154m) in combined income from salaries, bonuses and endorsements.[526] Forbes ranked him the world\\'s highest-paid athlete in 2019.[527] From 2008, he was Barcelona\\'s highest-paid player, receiving a salary that increased incrementally from €7.8\\xa0million to €13\\xa0million over the next five years.[81][82][146] Signing a new Barcelona contract in 2017, he earned $667,000 per week in wages, and Barcelona also paid him $59.6\\xa0million as a signing on bonus.[528] His buyout clause was set at $835\\xa0million (€700\\xa0million).[528] In 2020, Messi became the second footballer (and second athlete in a team sport), after Cristiano Ronaldo, to surpass $1 billion in earnings during their careers.[529]\\n\\n Billboard of Messi in Taipei, Taiwan\\nIn addition to his salary and bonuses, much of his income derives from endorsements; SportsPro has consequently cited him as one of the world\\'s most marketable athletes every year since their research began in 2010.[530] His main sponsor since 2006 is the sportswear company Adidas. As Barcelona\\'s leading youth prospect, he had been signed with Nike since age 14, but transferred to Adidas after they successfully challenged their rival\\'s claim to his image rights in court.[531] Over time, Messi established himself as their leading brand endorser;[523] from 2008, he had a long-running signature collection of Adidas F50 boots, and in 2015, he became the first footballer to receive his own sub-brand of Adidas boots, the Adidas Messi.[532][533] Since 2017, he has worn the latest version of the Adidas Nemeziz.[534] In 2015, a Barcelona jersey with Messi\\'s name and number was the best-selling replica jersey worldwide.[535]\\n\\n After blessing himself, Messi often celebrates a goal by pointing a finger on each hand towards the sky in dedication to his late grandmother.[536] His goal celebration features in the FIFA video game series, first appearing in FIFA 14.\\nAs a commercial entity, Messi\\'s marketing brand has been based exclusively on his talents and achievements as a player, in contrast to arguably more glamorous players like Cristiano Ronaldo and David Beckham. At the start of his career, he thus mainly held sponsorship contracts with companies that employ sports-oriented marketing, such as Adidas, Pepsi, and Konami.[537][538] From 2010 onwards, concurrently with his increased achievements as a player, his marketing appeal widened, leading to long-term endorsement deals with luxury brands Dolce & Gabbana and Audemars Piguet.[537][539] Messi is also a global brand ambassador for Gillette, Turkish Airlines, Ooredoo, and Tata Motors, among other companies.[540][541][542][543] Additionally, Messi was the face of Konami\\'s video game series Pro Evolution Soccer, appearing on the covers of PES 2009, PES 2010, PES 2011 and PES 2020. He subsequently signed with rival company EA Sports to become the face of their series FIFA and has since appeared on four consecutive covers from FIFA 13 to FIFA 16.[544][545]\\nMessi\\'s global popularity and influence are well documented. He was among the Time 100, an annual list of the world\\'s most influential people as published by Time, in 2011 and 2012.[546][547] His fanbase on the social media website Facebook is among the largest of all public figures: within seven hours of its launch in April 2011, Messi\\'s Facebook page had nearly seven\\xa0million followers, and by August 2021 he had over 103\\xa0million followers, the second highest for a sportsperson after Cristiano Ronaldo.[548][549] He also has over 280 million Instagram followers, the second highest for an individual and sportsperson after Cristiano Ronaldo.[550] According to a 2014 survey by sports research firm Repucom in 15 international markets, Messi was familiar to 87% of respondents around the world, of whom 78% perceived him favourably, making him the second-most recognised player globally, behind Ronaldo, and the most likable of all contemporary players.[551][552] On Messi\\'s economic impact on the city in which he plays, Terry Gibson called him a \"tourist attraction\".[553]\\n\\n Indian vehicle art of Messi\\nOther events have illustrated Messi\\'s presence in popular culture. A solid gold replica of his left foot, weighing 25\\xa0kg (55\\xa0lb) and valued at $5.25\\xa0million, went on sale in Japan in March 2013 to raise funds for victims of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.[554] A 2013 Turkish Airlines advertisement starring Messi, in which he engages in a selfie competition with then-Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant, was the most-watched ad on YouTube in the year of its release, receiving 137\\xa0million views, and was subsequently voted the best advertisement of the 2005–15 decade to commemorate YouTube\\'s founding.[555][556] World Press Photo selected \"The Final Game\", a photograph of Messi facing the World Cup trophy after Argentina\\'s final defeat to Germany, as the best sports image of 2014.[557] Messi, a documentary about his life by filmmaker Álex de la Iglesia, premiered at the Venice Film Festival in August 2014.[558]\\nIn June 2021, Messi signed a five-year deal to become an ambassador for the Hard Rock Cafe brand. He stated, \"sports and music are an integral part of my life. It is an honor to be the first athlete to partner with a brand who has a history of teaming with music legends.\"[559]\\n\\nPersonal life\\nFamily and relationships\\nSince 2008, Messi has been in a relationship with Antonela Roccuzzo, a fellow native of Rosario.[560] He has known Roccuzzo since he was five years old, as she is the cousin of his childhood best friend, Lucas Scaglia, who is also a football player.[561] After keeping their relationship private for a year, Messi first confirmed their romance in an interview in January 2009, before going public a month later during a carnival in Sitges after the Barcelona–Espanyol derby.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Leo is not shy. He\\'s introverted. He\\'s reserved.\"\\n\\n\\n— Endocrinologist Diego Schwarzstein,[note 4] who addressed Messi\\'s growth hormone deficiency from 1997 to 2001.\\n\\n\\nMessi and Roccuzzo have three sons: Thiago (born 2012), Mateo (born 2015) and Ciro (born 2018). To celebrate his partner\\'s first pregnancy, Messi placed the ball under his shirt after scoring in Argentina\\'s 4–0 win against Ecuador on 2 June 2012, before confirming the pregnancy in an interview two weeks later.[563] Thiago was born in Barcelona on 2 November 2012, with Messi attending the birth after being given permission by Barcelona to miss training.[564] Thiago\\'s name and handprints are tattooed on his left calf.[149] In April 2015, Messi confirmed that they were expecting another child.[565] He missed training ahead of a match against Atlético Madrid to attend the birth of his second son, Mateo, on 11 September 2015 in Barcelona.[566] On 30 June 2017, he married Roccuzzo at a luxury hotel named Hotel City Center in Rosario with about 260 guests attending his wedding.[567] On 15 October 2017, his wife announced they were expecting their third child.[568] On 10 March 2018, Messi skipped the match against Málaga after Ciro was born.[569]\\nMessi enjoys a close relationship with his immediate family members, particularly his mother, Celia, whose face he has tattooed on his left shoulder. His professional affairs are largely run as a family business: his father, Jorge, has been his agent since he was 14, and his oldest brother, Rodrigo, handles his daily schedule and publicity. His mother and other brother, Matías, manage his charitable organization, the Leo Messi Foundation, and take care of personal and professional matters in Rosario.[570]\\nSince leaving for Spain at age 13, Messi has maintained close ties to his hometown of Rosario, even preserving his distinct Rosarino accent. He has kept ownership of his family\\'s old house, although it has long stood empty; he maintains a penthouse apartment in an exclusive residential building for his mother, as well as a family compound just outside the city. Once when he was in training with the national team in Buenos Aires, he made a three-hour trip by car to Rosario immediately after practice to have dinner with his family, spent the night with them, and returned to Buenos Aires the next day in time for practice. Messi keeps in daily contact via phone and text with a small group of confidants in Rosario, most of whom were fellow members of \"The Machine of \\'87\" at Newell\\'s Old Boys. He currently lives in Castelldefels, a village near Barcelona. Although considered a one-club man, he has long planned to return to Rosario to end his playing career at Newell\\'s. He was on bad terms with the club after his transfer to Barcelona, but by 2012 their public feud had ended, with Newell\\'s embracing their ties with Messi, even issuing a club membership card to his newborn son.[17][571][572]\\n\\nPhilanthropy\\nThroughout his career, Messi has been involved in charitable efforts aimed at vulnerable children, a commitment that stems in part from the medical difficulties he faced in his own childhood. Since 2004, he has contributed his time and finances to the United Nations Children\\'s Fund (UNICEF), an organisation with which Barcelona also have a strong association.[573][574] Messi has served as a UNICEF goodwill ambassador since his appointment in March 2010, completing his first field mission for the organisation four months later as he travelled to Haiti to bring public awareness to the plight of the country\\'s children in the wake of the recent earthquake. He has since participated in UNICEF campaigns targeting HIV prevention, education, and the social inclusion of disabled children.[575] To celebrate his son\\'s first birthday, in November 2013, Messi and Thiago were part of a publicity campaign to raise awareness of mortality rates among disadvantaged children.[576]\\n\\n Messi (pictured in 2007) has worked with UNICEF since 2004 and has served as a UNICEF goodwill ambassador since 2010.\\nIn addition to his work with UNICEF, Messi founded his own charitable organisation, the Leo Messi Foundation, which supports access to health care, education, and sport for children.[577] It was established in 2007 following a visit Messi paid to a hospital for terminally ill children in Boston, an experience that resonated with him to the point that he decided to reinvest part of his earnings into society.[571] Through his foundation, Messi has awarded research grants, financed medical training, and invested in the development of medical centres and projects in Argentina, Spain, and elsewhere in the world.[571][578] In addition to his own fundraising activities, such as his global \"Messi and Friends\" football matches, his foundation receives financial support from various companies to which he has assigned his name in endorsement agreements, with Adidas as their main sponsor.[579][580]\\nMessi has also invested in youth football in Argentina: he financially supports Sarmiento, a football club based in the Rosario neighbourhood where he was born, committing in 2013 to the refurbishment of their facilities and the installation of all-weather pitches, and funds the management of several youth players at Newell\\'s Old Boys and rival club Rosario Central, as well as at River Plate and Boca Juniors in Buenos Aires.[571] At Newell\\'s Old Boys, his boyhood club, he funded the 2012 construction of a new gymnasium and a dormitory inside the club\\'s stadium for their youth academy. His former youth coach at Newell\\'s, Ernesto Vecchio, is employed by the Leo Messi Foundation as a talent scout for young players.[17] On 7 June 2016, Messi won a libel case against La Razón newspaper and was awarded €65,000 in damages, which he donated to the charity Médecins Sans Frontières.[581] Messi made a donation worth €1\\xa0million ($1.1\\xa0million) to fight the spread of coronavirus.[582] This was split between Clinic Barcelona hospital in Barcelona, Spain and his native Argentina.[583] In addition to this, Messi along with his fellow FC Barcelona teammates announced he will be taking a 70% cut in salaries during the 2020 coronavirus emergency, and contribute further to the club to provide fully to salaries of all the clubs employees.[584]\\nIn November 2016, with the Argentine Football Association being run by a FIFA committee for emergency due to an economic crisis, it was reported that three of the national team\\'s security staff told Messi that they had not received their salaries for six months. He stepped in and paid the salaries of the three members.[585][586] In February 2021, Messi donated his Adidas shoes to the Museu Nacional d\\'Art de Catalunya which he wore when he scored his 644th goal for Barcelona and broke Pelé\\'s record for most goals scored for a single club, the shoes were later auctioned off in April by the museum for charity to help children with cancer and were sold for £125,000.[587]\\nIn advance of the 2021 Copa América in Uruguay, Messi donated three signed shirts to the Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac Biotech—whose directors spoke of their admiration for Messi—in order to secure 50,000 doses of Sinovac\\'s COVID-19 vaccine, CoronaVac, in the hope of vaccinating all of South America\\'s football players.[588] A deal brokered by Uruguay\\'s president Luis Lacalle Pou, the plan to prioritise football players caused some controversy given widespread vaccine scarcity in the region, with the Mayor of Canelones in Uruguay remarking that \"Just as the president manifested cooperation with CONMEBOL to vaccinate for the Copa América, he could just as well have the same consideration for Canelones\".[588]\\n\\nTax fraud\\nMessi\\'s financial affairs came under investigation in 2013 for suspected tax evasion. Offshore companies in tax havens Uruguay and Belize were used to evade €4.1\\xa0million in taxes related to sponsorship earnings between 2007 and 2009. An unrelated shell company in Panama set up in 2012 was subsequently identified as belonging to the Messis in the Panama Papers data leak. Messi, who pleaded ignorance of the alleged scheme, voluntarily paid arrears of €5.1\\xa0million in August 2013. On 6 July 2016, Messi and his father were both found guilty of tax fraud and were handed suspended 21-month prison sentences and respectively ordered to pay €1.7\\xa0million and €1.4\\xa0million in fines.[589] Facing the judge, he said, \"I just played football. I signed the contracts because I trusted my dad and the lawyers and we had decided that they would take charge of those things.\"[590]\\n\\nCareer statistics\\nClub\\nAs of match played 29 April

his surname is the single \"Messi\", in accordance with Argentine customs.[4][5] Other sources, including a 2014 document by FIFA, give his surname as the double \"Messi Cuccittini\".[6] After winning a libel case in 2017, Messi\\'s own management company stated: \"The football player Lionel Andres Messi Cuccittini has donated a total of €72,783.20 to the organisation Doctors Without Borders.\"[7]\\n\\n^ In addition to four FIFA Ballons d\\'Or, Messi received France Football\\'s Ballon d\\'Or and FIFA\\'s World Player of the Year award in 2009 prior to their incorporation; both organisations credited him with five (FIFA) Ballons d\\'Or.[8][9] In 2019, he received a sixth Ballon d\\'Or and won the Best FIFA Men\\'s Player, before receiving a seventh Ballon d\\'Or in 2021.\\n\\n^ Assist statistics began in 1990.\\n\\n^ According to Bleacher Report\\'s Richard Fitzpatrick, \"Schwarzstein and Messi built up a close relationship during more than four years of treatment.\"[562]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n\\n^ \"FIFA World Cup Russia 2018: List of Players: Argentina\" (PDF).

He plays mainly as a central midfielder, but can also play as an attacking midfielder or as a defensive midfielder. He is widely regarded as one of the best midfielders of all time,[6] and as the greatest Croatian footballer ever.[7]\\nBorn in Zadar,[8] Modrić\\'s childhood coincided with the Croatian War of Independence which displaced his family.[9] In 2002, he was signed by Dinamo Zagreb at age 16, after showing promise with his hometown club NK Zadar\\'s youth team. He continued his development in Zagreb, before spells on loan to Zrinjski Mostar and Inter Zaprešić. He made his debut for Dinamo in 2005 and won three consecutive league titles and domestic cups, being named the Prva HNL Player of the Year in 2007. In 2008, he moved to Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur for a club-record transfer fee of £16.5\\xa0million, where he led Spurs to their first UEFA Champions League appearance in almost 50 years, reaching the quarter-finals of the 2010–11 tournament.\\nIn the summer of 2012, Modrić joined Real Madrid for a £30 million transfer fee. There he became a key contributor and helped the team win La Décima and was selected for the 2013–14 Champions League squad of the season. After Zinedine Zidane took over Madrid, Modrić was critical to three consecutive Champions League titles from 2015–16 to 2017–18, each time being voted into the squad of the season. He has won seventeen major trophies at Real Madrid, including four UEFA Champions League titles, two La Liga titles, one Copa del Rey and three FIFA Club World Cup titles. He won the La Liga Award for \"Best Midfielder\" in 2016 for the second time, and the UEFA Club Football Award for \"Best Midfielder\" in 2017 and 2018. In 2015, he became the first Croatian player to be included in the FIFA FIFPro World XI, in which he was regularly included until 2019, as well in the UEFA Team of the Year between 2016 and 2018. In 2018, Modrić became the first Croatian player to win the UEFA Men\\'s Player of the Year Award, and by winning The Best FIFA Men\\'s Player and Ballon d\\'Or awards, he became the first player other than Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo to claim the awards in more than a decade. In 2019, he was awarded the Golden Foot award for career results and personality.\\nModrić made his international debut for Croatia against Argentina in March 2006, and scored his first international goal in a friendly match against Italy. Modrić has anchored Croatia\\'s \"second Golden Generation\", participating in every major tournament Croatia has qualified for, including the UEFA European Championship in 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020, as well as the FIFA World Cup in 2006, 2014, and 2018. At Euro 2008, he was selected for the Team of the Tournament, becoming only the second Croatian to ever achieve this honour. Following group stage eliminations in his first two World Cups, Modrić led Croatia to the 2018 World Cup Final, and he received the Golden Ball award for best player of the tournament. In March 2021, he went on to become the country\\'s most capped player in history. Furthermore, he has been named Croatian Footballer of the Year a record ten times between 2007 and 2021.[10]\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 Early life\\n2 Club career\\n\\n2.1 Early years\\n2.2 Dinamo Zagreb\\n2.3 Tottenham Hotspur\\n\\n2.3.1 2008–10: Struggle and success in England\\n2.3.2 2010–12: Outgrowing Tottenham Hotspur\\n\\n\\n2.4 Real Madrid\\n\\n2.4.1 2012–13: Becoming a starting eleven player in Real Madrid\\n2.4.2 2013–15: Best midfielder in Spain and La Décima\\n2.4.3 2015–17: Among best world players and La Undécima and Duodécima\\n2.4.4 2017–18: Ballon d\\'Or and third consecutive Champions League title\\n2.4.5 2018–21: Second time champion of Spain and Golden Foot\\n2.4.6 2021–22: 10th season with Real Madrid\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3 International career\\n\\n3.1 2006–08: 2006 World Cup and Euro 2008\\n3.2 2008–16: Subsequent struggles\\n3.3 2016–18: Golden Ball of the 2018 World Cup\\n3.4 2018–22: Post-World Cup period\\n\\n\\n4 Player profile\\n\\n4.1 Style of play\\n4.2 Position\\n4.3 Reception\\n\\n\\n5 Personal life\\n\\n5.1 Legal issues\\n\\n\\n6 Career statistics\\n\\n6.1 Club\\n6.2 International\\n\\n\\n7 Honours\\n8 See also\\n9 References\\n10 Further reading\\n11 External links\\n\\n\\nEarly life\\n Modrić was born in Zadar, Croatia where he began his youth career at NK Zadar.\\nLuka Modrić was born on 9 September 1985 and was raised in the hamlet of Modrići, which is a part of Zaton Obrovački,[11][12] a village situated on the southern slopes of the mountain Velebit, north of the city of Zadar in SR Croatia, then a republic within SFR Yugoslavia.[13][14][15] He is the oldest child of Stipe Modrić from Modrići and Radojka Dopuđ from Kruševo near Obrovac, both of whom initially worked in a knitwear factory.[16][17][18][19] Modrić mostly spent his early years in the stone house of his paternal grandfather after whom he was named,[11][20] located on the road above the hamlet of Modrići,[21][22][23] and was shepherding goats as a five-year-old.[24][25][26]\\nHowever, his childhood coincided with the Croatian War of Independence—in 1991, when the war escalated, his family were forced to flee the area.[13] Modrić\\'s grandfather Luka was executed by Serb rebels who were part of the police of SAO Krajina in December 1991 near his house in Modrići,[13][15][27][28] and after the family fled, the house was burned to the ground.[29][30] Modrić became a refugee and lived with his family in the Hotel Kolovare for seven years; he later moved to the Hotel Iž, both in Zadar.[13][31][32] His father joined the Croatian Army as an aeromechanic.[13][33] In those years, thousands of bombs fell on the city and football was a way to escape the reality of war.[15] He recalls it as a tough time for his family and something which shaped him as a person.[34][35][36] He also said he was mostly unaware of the war because he befriended many other children and their parents did not let it affect their childhood.[18]\\nIn these difficult circumstances, Modrić began playing football, mostly at the hotel parking lot.[15] In 1992, he simultaneously entered the primary school and a sporting academy, the latter paid for with the little money the family had, sometimes helped by Modrić\\'s uncle.[13][31][18] As a boy he was inspired to play football by Zvonimir Boban and Francesco Totti.[37]\\n\\nClub career\\nEarly years\\nSupported by his family, he participated in representative camps and trained in NK Zadar.[13][18] He was under tutelage of coach Domagoj Bašić and the head of the youth academy, Tomislav Bašić.[13] Tomislav Bašić, considered by Modrić as his \"sporting father\",[28][32] said Modrić\\'s father made him wooden shin guards because they had little money.[13][34][36] However, Modrić later denied the story.[15] Due to being considered too young and light, he was not signed by Croatian powerhouse Hajduk Split, the most representative football club in the region of Dalmatia.[13][18][38] After displaying some talent, including at youth tournament in Italy,[28] Tomislav Bašić arranged Modrić\\'s move to Dinamo Zagreb when Modrić was a 16-year-old in late 2001.[13][15][39] After a season with Dinamo Zagreb\\'s youth side, Modrić was loaned in 2003 to Zrinjski Mostar in the Bosnian Premier League.[13][28] During this period, he established his versatile style of play and became the Bosnian Premier League Player of the Year at only the age of 18.[40] Modrić later said, \"Someone who can play in the Bosnian Premier League can play anywhere,\" referring to its physical nature.[40] The following year, he was loaned to Croatian side Inter Zaprešić. He spent one season there, helping the team to achieve second position in the Prva HNL[28][41] and a place in the preliminary round of the UEFA Cup. He also won the Croatian Football Hope of the Year award in 2004.[40] He returned to Dinamo Zagreb in 2005.[40]\\n\\nDinamo Zagreb\\nIn the 2005–06 season, Modrić signed a ten-year contract (his first long-term contract) with Dinamo Zagreb.[40] With the contract\\'s earnings, he bought a flat in Zadar for his family.[15][28] He secured a place in Dinamo\\'s first team, contributing 7 goals in 31 matches to help win the league.[42] In the 2006–07 season, Dinamo again won the league, with Modrić making a similar contribution.[42] He was the main provider for striker Eduardo,[40] which helped Modrić win the Prva HNL Player of the Year award.[3] The following season, Modrić as a team captain,[43] led Dinamo\\'s attempt to qualify for the 2007–08 UEFA Cup. In the final play-off stage, Modrić converted a penalty in the second and away fixture against Ajax; the match finished 1–1 after regular time. Dinamo won the match and play-off with a score of 3–2 after extra time with two goals from teammate Mario Mandžukić.[44] However, Dinamo Zagreb failed to advance beyond the group stage. In his last home match with the club at Maksimir Stadium, Modrić was given a standing ovation and fans held up supportive banners.[45][46] He finished his four-year tenure at Dinamo with a tally of over 31 goals and 29 assists in four league seasons,[28][47] contributing most notably in the 2007–08 season when Dinamo won the second Croatian Cup and became champions by a 28-point margin.[48] Modrić was courted by Barcelona, Arsenal and Chelsea, but opted to wait leaving the club.[28][49][50]\\n\\nTottenham Hotspur\\n2008–10: Struggle and success in England\\n Modrić (far left, No. 14), preparing for a match kick-off for Tottenham against Arsenal in November 2010.\\nModrić agreed to transfer terms with Tottenham Hotspur on 26 April 2008. He was the first of many summer signings for manager Juande Ramos, and was also the Premier League\\'s first summer transfer.[51] Club chairman Daniel Levy promptly flew to Zagreb when Manchester City and Newcastle United became interested,[52][53] and after signing a six-year contract, Tottenham confirmed the transfer fee paid was £16.5\\xa0million, equalling the club\\'s record fee set by Darren Bent\\'s move in 2007.[54] He got number 14 jersey, later recalling that he wore it in honour of Johan Cruyff.[55] Modrić made his competitive Premier League debut on 16 August in a 2–1 defeat to Middlesbrough at the Riverside Stadium in Spurs\\' first match of the 2008–09 season.[56]\\nModrić had a slow start at Tottenham. He suffered from a knee injury early in his tenure and was labelled as a light-weight for the Premier League by sections of the media,[39][35] as well as Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger.[57] Reflecting on that, Modrić said that such \"critics push you forward to show people they are wrong. Maybe I look lightweight but I am a really strong person mentally and physically, and I never had any problems with my size\".[39] This coincided with his poor form, leading to concerns both for himself and Croatia national team head coach Slaven Bilić.[57] Modrić spent his early days at a position of number 10, before being shifted to the left wing to play alongside Wilson Palacios.[57] Spurs teammate Tom Huddlestone later said, \"[H]is versatility was probably a blessing and a curse, he was that good that he had to play out of position for a bit.\"[57]\\nAfter the appointment of manager Harry Redknapp, Modrić was given a more familiar role as a central or left-sided midfielder, allowing him to have more influence on the team and use his footballing talent more productively, for example in a 4–4 draw with arch-rivals Arsenal on 29 October.[58] Redknapp recognised Modrić\\'s value to his side and planned to shape his new team around the Croatian playmaker.[59] He scored his first competitive goal at Tottenham in a 2–2 draw against Spartak Moscow during the UEFA Cup group stages on 18 December 2008.[60] He scored his first Premier League goals against Newcastle United in an away defeat on 21 December, a home win in the third round of the FA Cup against Wigan Athletic on 2 January 2009, and in an away defeat against Manchester United on 25 April 2009.[61] Using Modrić in his former position from his Dinamo days made him more effective with performances against Stoke City,[62] Hull City,[63] and most notably on 21 March when he scored the only goal in a win against Chelsea.[64]\\nBefore the 2009–10 season, Redknapp said of Modrić, \"[He\\'s] a hell of a player and a manager\\'s dream, so I am told. He trains like a demon and never complains, will work with and without the ball on the field and can beat a defender with a trick or with a pass. He could get into any team in the top four\".[65] On 29 August 2009, during Tottenham\\'s 2–1 win over Birmingham City, Modrić was taken off injured with a suspected calf injury.[66] The following day, it was confirmed Modrić had sustained a fracture to his right fibula and was expected to be out for six weeks.[67] He returned on 28 December in the London derby against West Ham United, which Spurs won 2–0 with an 11th-minute goal scored by Modrić using the leg he had broken.[68] He again scored in a home win against Everton on 28 February 2010,[69] and in an away defeat against Burnley on 9 May.[70] On 30 May 2010, Modrić signed a new six-year contract that ran until 2016. Upon signing, he said, \"Tottenham Hotspur gave me my chance in the Premier League and I want to go on to achieve great success here with them. Yes, there have been enquiries from other big clubs, but I have no interest in going anywhere. Last season\\'s top-four finish was an indication of where we are as a club and I feel I can continue to improve and go on to achieve everything I want to at Spurs.\"[71]\\n\\n2010–12: Outgrowing Tottenham Hotspur\\n Modrić playing against Arsenal in November 2010.\\nOn 11 September 2010, Modrić scored his first goal of the 2010–11 season in a 1–1 away draw at West Bromwich Albion.[72] On 28 November, in a home match against Liverpool, Modrić scored a goal that was later credited as an own goal by Martin Škrtel. After a draw against Manchester United at White Hart Lane in January 2011, Redknapp praised Modrić, saying, \"He was unbelievable. Magnificent. He\\'s an amazing footballer, the little man takes the ball in the tightest areas with people around him, wriggling out of situations. He could play in any team in the world.\"[73] Modrić also scored in Tottenham\\'s 3–2 victory over Stoke City on 9 April,[74] and converted a penalty at Anfield on 15 May in a 2–0 victory over Liverpool.[75] Modrić helped Tottenham reach their first involvement in the UEFA Champions League. In the first match, against Inter Milan at the San Siro on 20 October, he exited the match early due to injury; Spurs lost 4–3, despite the tremendous efforts of Gareth Bale.[76] On the return match at home, on 2 November, Modrić was given too much space to move and dictate the tempo of the match. He created and assisted for the first goal by Rafael van der Vaart in a 3–1 victory.[77][78] In the next match, against Werder Bremen, Modrić scored the second goal.[79] After a scoreless draw against Milan,[80] Spurs were eliminated from the competition in the quarter-finals by Real Madrid.[81]\\nModrić played 32 Premier League matches in the 2010–11 season, scoring three goals, recording two assists and making the highest average number of passes per match for Spurs with 62.5 and an accuracy rate of 87.4%.[82] At the end of the season, Modrić was voted the Tottenham Hotspur Player of the Year. Then-Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson said he would have chosen Modrić as his Player of the Year for that season.[83]\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I spent four great years there with a lot of emotions, with a lot of love from the club and the fans. I enjoyed every moment with Tottenham. But in one moment you feel you need to take a step forward, to go to a higher level. I think it was the right time for me to go, but I will always be thankful to Tottenham for everything they did for me. I became a better player there and they pushed me to this level where I am at the moment.\"\\n\\n\\n—Luka Modrić reflecting on negotiations with Chelsea and move to Real Madrid in February 2014.[39]\\n\\n\\nIn mid-2011, Modrić was heavily pursued by Tottenham\\'s London rivals Chelsea, who made a first bid of £22\\xa0million, which they increased to £27\\xa0million, both of which were rejected by Spurs chairman Daniel Levy.[84][85] After the failed bids, Modrić announced he would welcome a move across London and that he had a \"gentleman\\'s agreement\" with Levy the club would entertain offers from a \"big club\".[86] Speculation continued throughout the summer transfer window, culminating in Modrić refusing to play in Tottenham\\'s opening match of the 2011–12 season against Manchester United, which ended in a 3–0 loss.[87] Modrić said his \"head was not in the right place\" as he continued to force a move to Chelsea.[88] On the final day of the transfer window, Chelsea made an offer of £40\\xa0million that was again rejected.[89]\\nAfter failing to secure a transfer, Spurs manager Harry Redknapp told Modrić to focus on his playing and named him as a starter.[90] On 18 September, he scored his first goal of the season for Tottenham with a shot from 25\\xa0yd (23\\xa0m) in a 4–0 home win against Liverpool.[91] On 14 January 2012, Modrić scored the only goal in a home draw with Wolverhampton Wanderers.[92] On 31 January in a 3–1 win against Wigan Athletic, he assisted for the first goal with a crossfield pass and scored the second from 20\\xa0yd (18\\xa0m).[93] For the third time that season, he was included in \"Team of the Week\".[94] Modrić scored his last goal for Tottenham on 2 May in a 1–4 away win against Bolton Wanderers with a powerful volley from 25\\xa0yd (23\\xa0m).[95]\\n\\nReal Madrid\\n2012–13: Becoming a starting eleven player in Real Madrid\\n Modrić playing against Sevilla in February 2013.\\nOn 27 August 2012, Real Madrid announced they had agreed on a deal with Tottenham for an approximate £30\\xa0million transfer fee.[96] Modrić signed a five-year contract with the Spanish club.[96][97] Two days later, he made his Real Madrid debut against Barcelona in the second leg final of the 2012 Supercopa de España at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, replacing Mesut Özil in the 83rd minute. Madrid won the match, giving Modrić his first trophy with the club 36 hours after his signing was announced.[98] Despite his positive debut, Modrić at first struggled to settle into the team under manager José Mourinho because of his lack of pre-season training, which he missed as a result of his ongoing transfer negotiations.[39] The presence of veteran midfielder Xabi Alonso and Sami Khedira in defensive midfield, and Özil in offensive midfield, usually kept Modrić out of the starting line-up, limiting him to substitute appearances. He mostly played out-of-position for his first few months at the club. He played his first UEFA Champions League match for Real Madrid in the group stage against Manchester City on 18 September, which Madrid won 3–2. On 3 November, Modrić scored his first goal for Real Madrid in the last minute of their 4–0 victory over Real Zaragoza in La Liga.[99] On 17 November, Modrić assisted a Karim Benzema goal, which was eventually ruled an own goal by Jon Aurtenetxe, with a 50\\xa0m (55\\xa0yd) cross-field pass. It was the first goal in a 5–1 victory over Athletic Bilbao.[100] His most notable match that year was on 4 December, when he assisted for the first two goals of Cristiano Ronaldo and José Callejón with cross-field passes in a 4–1 victory over Ajax in the group stage of the Champions League.[101][102][103] At the end of the year he was voted as the worst signing of the season by Spanish newspaper Marca.[104]\\nModrić started in Real Madrid\\'s home match against rivals Barcelona on 2 March 2013. From a corner kick, he assisted Sergio Ramos to score the winning goal in the 82nd minute, giving Real a victory in El Clásico. On 5 March, Modrić came on as a second-half substitute during the decisive Champions League knockout leg against ten-man Manchester United at Old Trafford. With Madrid behind by a goal, Modrić equalised with a long-range shot from 25\\xa0yd (23\\xa0m) out and played a key role in the rest of the match, which Real Madrid won 2–1, advancing them to the quarter-finals 3–2 on aggregate.[105][106][107] This match is often seen as the turning point in Modrić\\'s career in Real Madrid.[39] On 16 March, he replicated this performance against Mallorca, giving Real Madrid the lead with a long-range volley from 30\\xa0yd (27\\xa0m); Real Madrid won the match 5–2.[108] Modrić played as a starter in both Champions League semi-final matches against Borussia Dortmund. In the first leg on 24 April, he played in the attacking midfield position where he did not influence the match and the team lost 4–1. On 30 April, in the second leg 2–0 victory, Modrić played as the deep-lying playmaker, making passes to the attackers and creating several chances; he was among the best-rated players that night.[109][110][111] From March 2013, Modrić\\'s form and influence in the midfield continued to improve, distinguishing himself as a player with most passes completed in his team. On 8 May, he assisted from the corner for the first goal and scored the fourth goal in a 6–2 victory over Málaga.[112]\\n\\n2013–15: Best midfielder in Spain and La Décima\\n\\n\\n\"He\\'s the head of midfield in a complicated environment.

The goal was ultimately decisive because Real went on to lose 2–0 in the second leg, but progressed with a marginal aggregate score of 3–2. In his 100th appearance for the club,[119] Modrić assisted for the first goal in the second leg 4–0 victory over Bayern Munich in the Champions League semi-final, helping Real Madrid reach the final for the first time in 12 years.[120] He was included in UEFA\\'s Team of the Week for both legs of the semi-final.[121][122] On 24 May in the final, Modrić again assisted from a corner for teammate Sergio Ramos, who scored a 93rd-minute equaliser against local rivals Atlético Madrid. Real won 4–1 in extra time, marking the club\\'s tenth Champions League title, locally known as la Décima (\"the tenth\").[123] He was included in the UEFA Champions League Team of the Season[124] and received the LFP award for the \"Best Midfielder\" of the Spanish first league of that season.[125]\\nIn August 2014, Modrić signed a new contract to stay at Real Madrid until 2018.[126] With the departure of Alonso he was partnered with newly arrived Toni Kroos.[127] Real Madrid began the 2014–15 season by winning the UEFA Super Cup over Sevilla[128] Modrić assisted twice for Bale, first against Real Sociedad in La Liga,[129] and second against Basel in the Champions League.[130][131] In the 2–0 away win against Villarreal, Modrić scored his seventh goal from outside of the box.[132]\\nIn late November, Modrić sustained a thigh injury during an international match against Italy, because of which he did not play for three months.[133] He returned in early March 2015, starting in seven matches and proving his form.[134] On 21 April, in the 3–1 home win against Málaga, he strained ligaments in his right knee, because of which he did not play until May.[135][136][137] With his injury, Real Madrid\\'s 22-match winning run in the season came to an end. His absence and the lack of a quality substitute were seen as the main cause of Real Madrid\\'s failure to win matches in La Liga and the Champions League.[138] Ancelotti said, \"Modrić has missed most of the year and this has hurt us\".[139] Modrić\\'s influence was recognised and he was selected by professional players in the FIFA FIFPro World XI.[140]\\n\\n2015–17: Among best world players

replaced by Rafael Benítez under whom Modrić continued to be a key midfield player.[141][142] Modrić began the season assisting in September, November and December, and scoring in the 3–4 away win against Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League group stage.[143] He sustained a muscular groin injury during an international match against Bulgaria in October, initially suggesting an absence of two-to-three weeks.[144] However, by 20 October, he had recovered in time for the match against Paris Saint-Germain.[145]\\nWith the arrival of new manager Zinedine Zidane in January 2016,[146] the relationship between them was noted in the media, with Modrić described as \"master of the game\",[141][147] and the crucial \"connector\" of the defence and attack.[148] It was seen in the first three matches, wins against Deportivo de La Coruña and Sporting de Gijón and a draw against Real Betis, in which Modrić was praised for creating chances, his positioning and overall performance and influence.[141][148][149] On 7 February, Modrić scored a winning goal from outside the box in a 1–2 away win against Granada.[150] Modrić was a regular in the starting line-up when the team won the 2015–16 Champions League in the final against Atlético Madrid.[151] He was included in both Champions League,[152] and La Liga\\'s team of the season.[153] For the second time, he also received the LFP award for the \"Best Midfielder\" of the Spanish first league.[154] He was for the second time included in the FIFA FIFPro World XI.[155]\\nOn 18 October 2016, Modrić signed a new contract with

season[164] and became the first Croatian to win the Champions League three times.[165] He also received the UEFA Club Football award for Best Midfielder of the Champions League season.[166] In the competition for the UEFA Men\\'s Player of the Year Award, he came fourth,[167] while for 2017 Ballon d\\'Or, fifth.[168] For the third time, he was also included in the FIFA FIFPro World XI.[169]\\n\\n2017–18: Ballon d\\'Or and third consecutive Champions League title\\n Modrić (left) with Gareth Bale during the 2018 Champions League Final.\\nWith the departure of James Rodríguez to Bayern Munich, Modrić inherited the team\\'s coveted number 10 jersey for the new 2017–18 season, replacing his previous number 19 jersey.[170] In December, he won the 2017 FIFA Club World Cup with

for the third consecutive time.[175] He later received the UEFA Club Football Award for Best Midfielder of the Champions League season for the second consecutive time.[176]\\nDue to his club, and national team performance at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, where also received the Golden Ball,[177] in August and September Modrić won the UEFA Men\\'s Player of the Year Award and The Best FIFA Men\\'s Player Award,[178][179] while in December, he added the Ballon d\\'Or to his personal tally,[180] marking the first time since 2007 that the award was not won by Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo, which polarized the people involved in the sport into two camps about the credibility of the award.[180][181][182] Furthermore, besides becoming the first Croatian player to win these awards,[183] Modrić was the first player to win both the World Cup Golden Ball and the UEFA Men\\'s Player of the Year Award in the same year since Ronaldo in 1998,[184] and the World Cup Golden Ball and the Best FIFA Men\\'s Player of the Year Award after Romário in 1994.[185] Additionally, he is the first player to win the awards from the former Yugoslavia territory, the first footballer from Eastern Europe to win a Ballon d\\'Or after Andriy Shevchenko in 2004,[186][187] and the tenth player from Real Madrid to capture the trophy.[188] Furthermore, winning the trophy triggered a clause in his contract, ensuring his stay at the club until 2021.[189] He was also included in the FIFA FIFPro World XI for the fourth time,[190] and won the IFFHS World\\'s Best Playmaker award.[191]\\nAfter receiving the FIFA Men\\'s Player of the Year Award, Modrić stated it \"shows that we all can become the best with hard work, dedication, and belief, all dreams can come true\".[192] Modrić dedicated the Ballon d\\'Or to \"all the players who probably deserved to win it and didn\\'t\" in the past decade, including Xavi, Andrés Iniesta, and Wesley Sneijder among others.[180]\\n\\n2018–21: Second time champion of Spain and Golden Foot\\nThe arrival of new manager Julen Lopetegui in August 2018 saw Modrić given a steady return to the first team as a substitute due to his lack of pre-season training after the 2018 World Cup.[193][194] This included a substitute appearance in his team\\'s 2–4 loss after extra time against Atlético Madrid in the UEFA Super Cup.[195] His first start of the season came on 1

respectively.[203][204][205] Despite having had an underwhelming season,[206] for the fifth consecutive time he was included in the FIFA FIFPro World XI.[207]\\nOn 27 August 2019 was the seventh anniversary of Modrić\\'s signing with the club.[208] Although raising doubts due to age of 34 and decision to continue playing with the national team which makes him prone to injuries,[209] Modrić stated that wants to \"recapture his best form this season\".[206] On 1 September and 9 November made his first assists in a 2–2 away draw against Villarreal and in a 0–4 away victory against

continuation of La Liga after a three month suspension due to COVID-19 pandemic, Modrić was praised for being one of Real Madrid\\'s best players despite his age, resulting in numerous media outlets wondering about prolongation of his contract with the club.[217] On 16 July, he assisted Benzema\\'s opening goal in a 2–1 victory over Villarreal, as Real Madrid secured the league title.[218][219]\\nOn 21 October 2020, he scored his first goal of the 2020–21 season in a Champions League 3–2 defeat to Shakhtar Donetsk.[220] The goal made him the fourth player in the history of the club to score in the competition aged 35 or more, alongside Alfredo Di Stéfano, Ferenc Puskás and Francisco Gento.[221] It was named the Goal of the Week by UEFA.[222] Three days later, he came off the bench to score with trivela his first ever Clásico goal, as Real Madrid defeated Barcelona 3–1.[223][224] On 25 May 2021, he extended his contract with Real Madrid until 2022.[225][226]\\n\\n2021–22: 10th season with Real Madrid\\nOn 24 October 2021 of 2021–22 season, Modrić played his 400th game for Real Madrid in a 2–1 Clásico victory.[227] On 30 October, Modrić captained Real Madrid for the first time and assisted for the winning goal, after Marcelo had given him the armband upon being substituted off in the 2–1 victory over Elche.[228][229] On 7 December 2021, he played his 100th Champions League game and was named Man of the Match in a 2–0 victory over Inter Milan.[230] On 16 January 2022, he scored the first goal in the 2022 Supercopa de España Final and was named Man of the Match, as Real Madrid defeated Athletic Bilbao 2–0.[231] The goal made him the oldest goalscorer in the history of the competition.[232] On 5 March, Modrić assisted and

He is said to anchor Croatia\\'s second Golden Generation.\\nModrić began his international career at youth level, playing for the Croatian under-15, under-17, under-18, under-19 and under-21 teams.[40] He debuted in March 2001 for the under-15 team coached by Martin Novoselac, but nevertheless his talent and psychological maturity, he did not become a regular starter and leading player until physically strengthened and debuted for under-18. Novoselac considers him as a model for all young players because is a result of a gradual and continuous work and effort, as well as talent.[239] Modrić made his full international debut for Croatia on 1 March 2006 in a friendly match against Argentina in Basel, which Croatia won 3–2.[40]\\n\\n2006–08: 2006 World Cup and Euro 2008\\nModrić made two appearances at the 2006 FIFA World Cup finals as a substitute in the group fixtures against Japan,[240] and Australia.[241] With the appointment of new manager Slaven Bilić, Modrić earned greater recognition at international level; he scored his first goal in Croatia\\'s 2–0 friendly win over world champions Italy on 16 August 2006 in Livorno.[242]\\nModrić\\'s performances ensured a regular place in the international side and he gave a successful showing in Croatia\\'s UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying campaign, which included home and away victories against England.[243][244] As a young midfielder, much was expected of Modrić; he was often dubbed \"the Croatian Cruyff\".[50][245] Modrić scored Croatia\\'s first goal of Euro 2008, converting a penalty in the fourth minute of their 1–0 victory against hosts Austria on 8 June 2008 and becoming the team\\'s youngest ever goalscorer at the European Championships (aged 22 years and 273 days).[246][247] It was also the fastest penalty ever awarded and scored in the European Championships history.[248] He continued to impress at the tournament and was named UEFA Man of the Match in Croatia\\'s next match when they defeated one of the pre-tournament favourites and eventual finalists Germany.[249] In the quarter-final against Turkey, Modrić took advantage of a mistake by veteran Turkish goalkeeper Rüştü Reçber, and crossed to teammate Ivan Klasnić for the first goal of the match with one minute of extra time remaining, but Semih Şentürk almost immediately equalised for Turkey. In the ensuing penalty shootout, Modrić\\'s kick was off-target and he failed to score the first penalty and Turkey won the shootout 3–1.[250] At the end of the competition, Modrić was included in the UEFA Team of the Tournament, becoming only the second Croatian to achieve this honour after Davor Šuker.[251]\\n\\n2008–16: Subsequent struggles\\nIn the 2010 World Cup qualifiers, Modrić scored three goals, against Kazakhstan,[252] Andorra,[253] and Ukraine;[254] matching Ivica Olić, Ivan Rakitić and Eduardo. The team failed to qualify finishing one point behind second-placed Ukraine. After appearing in all of their UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying matches and scoring a goal against Israel,[255] Modrić started in all three of Croatia group stage matches against the Republic of Ireland, Italy and Spain, but the team failed to progress. His most notable performance was against Spain. The most memorable moment of the match came when Modrić picked the ball on the halfway line skipping Spain\\'s midfield trio, rushing down on the right to reach the penalty area where he evaded a defender and with a trivela crossed from 18\\xa0yd (16\\xa0m) to Ivan Rakitić, but Iker Casillas saved this attempt.[256][257] Because Croatia did not advance from the group stage, Modrić was not included in the Team of the Tournament, although The Daily Telegraph included him in the best 11 until the semi-finals,[258] and his play was well received by critics.[259][260]\\n\\n Modrić playing against Neymar of Brazil at the 2014 FIFA World Cup.\\nAfter the playoffs, Modrić with the Croatian team qualified for the 2014 World Cup. They entered Group A with hosts Brazil, Mexico and Cameroon. Croatia played the opening match against Brazil, which they lost 3–1,[261] and Modrić sustained a minor foot injury.[262][263] In the second match, Croatia won 4–0 against Cameroon,[264] but did not progress to the knockout stage after losing 3–1 to Mexico,[265] despite the great expectations from the Croatian press and public.[266]\\nIn the Euro 2016 qualifying rounds, Modrić scored his first goals for Croatia in three years, the first against Malta on his 29th birthday with a long-range shot,[267] then a penalty against Azerbaijan.[268] On 3 March 2015, Modrić captained Croatia for the first time, in an away draw against Azerbaijan.[269] In the tournament proper, Modrić scored the match-winning goal in Croatia\\'s opening group stage match against Turkey, a volley from 25 metres (28 yards).[270] In so doing, he became the first Croatian to score at the finals of two separate European Championships, having previously scored against Austria in 2008.[271] He was named Man of the Match.[270] Modrić was forced to miss the crucial fixture against Spain on 21 June because of a minor muscle injury.[272][273] However, Croatia won and topped the group,[274] but lost to Portugal 0–1 in extra-time in the round of 16.[275]\\n\\n2016–18: Golden Ball of the 2018 World Cup\\n Modrić with Croatia during the World Cup.\\nFor Croatia\\'s 2018 World Cup qualifying campaign, Modrić became the new team captain, following Darijo Srna\\'s retirement.[276] Croatia started the campaign well; however, following 1–0 defeats to Iceland[277] and Turkey[278] and a 1–1 draw with Finland (in which Modrić made his 100th appearance for the national team),[279][280] Croatia seriously compromised their qualification for the tournament.[281][282] This caused Modrić to publicly state his lack of confidence in coach Ante Čačić.[283][284][285] Čačić was soon replaced by Zlatko Dalić ahead of Croatia\\'s final qualifier against Ukraine away,[286] which Croatia won 2–0 and won a place in the play-offs.[287] Modrić scored a penalty in the 4–1 victory over Greece in the second qualifying round,[288] enabling his team to qualify for the World Cup.\\nCroatia were placed in Group D alongside Argentina, Iceland and Nigeria. During the tournament, Modrić—along with Ivan Rakitić and Mario Mandžukić—were referred to as Croatia\\'s second \"Golden Generation\".[289][290] In Croatia\\'s opening win against Nigeria, Modrić once again successfully executed a penalty kick and was named Man of the Match.[291][292] He also scored in Croatia\\'s subsequent 3–0 win over Argentina with a long-range shot from 25 yards (23 metres),[293] also being named Man of the Match.[294][295] After also featuring in the final group stage match, against Iceland, his performances in the first round of the tournament saw him ranked by FourFourTwo, The Daily Telegraph and ESPN as the best player of the group stage.[296][297][298]\\nIn the round of 16 against Denmark on 1 July, with the score tied at 1–1, Modrić created a goalscoring opportunity for Ante Rebić in the second half of extra-time, who was brought down in the penalty area; Modrić proceeded to take the penalty, but his strike was saved by Kasper Schmeichel. However, Modrić managed to score his spot-kick during the ensuing penalty shoot-out and Croatia advanced to the next round following a 3–2 victory on penalties.[299][300][301] In the quarter-finals against hosts Russia on 7 July, Modrić provided an assist in extra-time for Domagoj Vida from a corner kick, and once again scored in the victorious penalty shoot-out following a 2–2 draw; he was named Man of the Match for the third time in the tournament.[302][303] In the semi-final against England on 11 July, Croatia advanced to the World Cup final for the first time in their history following a 2–1 victory in extra time.[304] It was reported two days before the final match that Modrić ran the most miles out of any player and was third by created chances, as well had most dribbles per match and completed passes in the opponent\\'s half in his team.[305] Although Croatia were beaten 4–2 by France in the final on 15 July,[306] Modrić was awarded the Golden Ball for the best player of the tournament,[177] and was included in the Team of the Tournament.[307][308] After the squad\\'s huge welcome in Zagreb,[309] Modrić and his teammates Danijel Subašić, Šime Vrsaljko and Dominik Livaković were welcomed by tens of thousands of people in their hometown of Zadar.[310]\\n\\n2018–22: Post-World Cup period\\nModrić took part in all four matches in the inaugural edition of the UEFA Nations League as Croatia finished at the bottom of Group A4 following historical 6–0 away defeat to Spain in September and a 2–1 defeat to England at the Wembley Stadium in November.[311][312]\\nDuring the Euro 2020 qualifying rounds, Modrić scored two goals; a penalty in the away 1–1 draw with Azerbaijan and a solo-effort in the home 3–0 victory over Hungary as Croatia topped the group and qualified for the tournament.[313][314] However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the tournament was postponed for a year.[315] On 24 March 2021, Modrić made his 134th appearance for the national team in a 1–0 2022 World Cup qualifying defeat to Slovenia, equaling Darijo Srna as the most capped player in the history of the team.[316] Three days later, in a 1–0 World Cup qualifying victory over Cyprus, he surpassed Srna\\'s record.[317][318]\\nHe was selected to the final squad for the UEFA Euro 2020 on 17 May.[319] Despite Croatia\\'s poor showings in their first two group stage games, Modrić was named the Man of the Match in the second one, a 1–1 draw with the Czech Republic on 18 June.[320] Four days later, in the 3–1 victory over Scotland, with a trivela he scored Croatia\\'s second goal and provided Ivan Perišić with an assist for the third goal as Croatia progressed to the round of 16.[321] Modrić\\'s goal made him Croatia\\'s oldest ever goalscorer at the European Championships (aged 35 years and 286 days), while simultaneously holding the record for the youngest goalscorer that he set in 2008.[247]\\nDuring the 2022 World Cup qualifying, Modrić scored three times and assisted twice in seven appearances.[322]\\n\\nPlayer profile\\nStyle of play\\n\\n\\n\"Not only is he a very hard worker, he has a good brain and he provided some calmness and composure to the midfield. His passing was neat and his contribution was outstanding. He was not only winning the ball, he was passing well. We thought that he was very influential. He did not just work hard, he made the other people play well around him\".\\n\\n\\n–Gérard Houllier, UEFA Technical Team[249]\\n\\n\\nA diminutive and technically gifted midfielder, Modrić is typically deployed as a creative playmaker and sets the tempo of the match by controlling possession from the middle of the pitch. He has been widely applauded by many footballing pundits, managers, and fellow players for his swift passing and long range shots, both often in the style of the trivela technique, as well as his composure and ability to evade tackles under pressure.[323][324][57][325][326][327] He is also noted for his tactical intelligence and versatility in both attack and defense, as well as his vision, interpretation of space, and work rate. A former attacking midfielder, Modrić is considered a veteran of the \"pre-assist\" or build-up play, often creating space and time for his teammates to shoot or deliver goal-bound passes to other players.[328][329][330][331] He is also effective at taking set pieces, particularly corners or wide free kicks.[332]\\nModrić has been integral to the success of both Real Madrid and the Croatia national team, having won numerous individual honours for his contributions to club and country.[139][333] His playstyle has earned him several nicknames as dubbed by the media and fandom, including “the midfield Maestro”, “the magician”, \"the puppet master\" among others.[334][328][335][336][337] He has also been compared to an orchestra conductor for his capacity to control his team’s gameplan or dictate the tempo of the match.[338]\\n\\nPosition\\nModrić\\'s complex game has brought him consistent success in the clubs for which he has played. Initially a trequartista or attacking midfielder at Dinamo Zagreb and in his early career at Tottenham, in the 2010–11 season he flourished in a central midfield role as a deep-lying playmaker (regista) who conducts the attack and creates chances for teammates.[339] Afterwards, Modrić acknowledged the role that Harry Redknapp played in shaping of deep-lying his style, saying that dropping back enabled him \"to read the game better\" and show his full \"creativity\".[340] Although a central midfielder, Modrić is also a hard-working player who has been seen to adopt a defensive midfield role in addition to playmaking, tracking back to win the ball from the opposition and prepare for a counter-attack, making him one of the most versatile players in the world, capable of playing in several midfield positions.[341][342] According to Jonathan Wilson, in a 4–2–3–1 system Modrić is a third type of a holding midfielder, being \"neither entirely destructive or creative\", but a \"carrier\" who – courtesy of his dribbling ability and attacking drive –\\xa0is \"capable of making late runs or carrying the ball at his feet\", but in his case \"with a hint of regista\".[343][344][345] As such, his role has also been likened to that of a mezzala, in Italian football jargon, namely an offensive–minded box–to-box or central midfielder.[331]\\nThe switch to a more deep-lying position reduced his number of assists and goals, as well as his shot per game count (1.2), although his game was no longer based on being a goal threat; despite this, he had the second-highest count of key passes per game (2.06) in the team, as well as a very high pass accuracy rate (87%), with the highest passes per game count (62.5) in the team, the most long balls per game (5.6), the most successful dribbles (2.2), interceptions (2.5), and the highest tackle (1.9) count per game among others, high statistics which placed him amongst the top midfielders of the Premier League.[339][346] By the 2011–12 season statistically he was among the top-rated central and all-round midfielders across the top five leagues, alongside players like Xabi Alonso, Andrea Pirlo, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Xavi.[347][348]\\nUpon Modrić\\'s arrival to Real Madrid, his midfield position was described as numbers six (defensive), eight (central) or ten (attacking), depending on the tactics,[349] and his role was described as the second deep-lying pivot alongside Xabi Alonso in the 2012–13 season, a classic deep-lying playmaker whose creativity was needed to dictate his team\\'s play and unlock the opposing defence.[350][351] In the first half of the 2013–14 season, during which he formed an effective central midfield partnership with Alonso and Ángel Di María, Modrić made more tackles (56) than any other Real Madrid player in La Liga with an average number of 2.86 tackles per match, as well as making the most completed passes (878) in the opposition half of the pitch among Real Madrid players, with the highest passing accuracy in La Liga (90%) (also the highest of any midfielder in Europe\\'s top five leagues who have made five or more assists during the season).[39] In the 2014–15 season, with the arrival of Toni Kroos, Real Madrid no longer had an effective and natural ball-winner alongside their playmakers in midfield, while the team possessed many attackers. Therefore, in addition to producing the highest count of passes (60.7–64.7) and key passes per match (0.8–1.2) within the team, both Modrić and Kroos had more defensive responsibility to set the rhythm of the team\\'s gameplay in midfield and orchestrate counterattacks.[127][352] Modrić\\'s average passing accuracy during the season was between 91.6–92%, while his highest completion rate in a single match occurred in October against Barcelona when he completed all 42 attempted passes.[353] For all of 2014, Modrić\\'s dribble attempts (75) at a success rate of 76% were second in Europe\\'s top five leagues.[354] During the 2015–16 season, although he placed only 12th in terms of chances created, almost all players above him were either forwards or attacking midfielders with no defensive responsibilities.[329]\\n\\nReception\\n Considered the most versatile and critical member of the national team, Modrić\\'s technical ability has been heralded by both players and coaches.\\nModrić is widely regarded as one of the best and most well-rounded and effective midfielders of all time.[6] According to Jonathan Wilson, what sets Modrić apart from traditional playmakers is his simultaneous focus on defensive and attacking duties.[355][356] Due to his footballing intelligence, skill and fairplay he was compared to Paul Scholes,[357][358] Xavi, Andrés Iniesta,[359] and Andrea Pirlo.[360][361][362] In his youth, he had also been compared to Johan Cruyff,[50][245] while his main influences were compatriot Zvonimir Boban and Italian playmaker Francesco Totti.[37]\\nHe has been consistently praised by some of the sport\\'s most experienced managers, including Johan Cruyff,[363] Alex Ferguson,[357] Pep Guardiola,[364] and Sven-Göran Eriksson among others.[365] From those who managed him, José Mourinho said he wanted Modrić in Real Madrid because of his influence on the game, tactical level and because he has \"that artistic sense\".[349] Carlo Ancelotti praised Modrić\\'s technique and versatility making him \"one of the best midfielders in the world right now, because he can play in more than one position\".[366][367] Zinedine Zidane included him in his best XI currently playing the game,[368] and in 2016 predicted that Modrić would win Ballon d\\'Or.[55] Slaven Bilić said Modrić \"is a player who makes others better, they all benefit from him being in the team. He\\'s not selfish, he\\'s playing for the team\\xa0...\\xa0he\\'s a complete player; good in defence, good in offence—it looks like he was born with the ball at his feet\".[57]\\nModrić is unanimously considered the greatest Croatian footballer of all time by his fellow countrymen including those who were once considered as such like Robert Prosinečki and Davor Šuker.[52][369][370][371] Predrag Mijatović considered him as the best footballer in the history of the Balkans,[372] while Andriy Shevchenko, Rio Ferdinand, Jan Oblak among others have stated to be one of the greatest midfielders to ever play.[373][374][375]\\n\\nPersonal life\\nModrić married Vanja Bosnić in May 2010 in the Croatian capital Zagreb in a private ceremony after four years of dating,[376] and a year later in church.[377] Their son, Ivano, was born on 6 June 2010.[378][379] Their daughter, Ema, was born on 25 April 2013.[379][380] Their second daughter, Sofia, was born on 2 October 2017.[381] Modrić generally maintains a low profile outside of football.[39][382] In addition to his native Croatian, Modrić also speaks English[383][384] and Spanish,[385][386] and is Roman Catholic.[387]\\nModrić is a cousin of Australian footballer Mark Viduka,[388] and the godfather of Mateo Kovačić\\'s son Ivan.[389]\\nIn late 2019, Modrić released his autobiography Moja igra (My Game), co-written by prominent Croatian sports journalist Robert Matteoni.[390][391]\\nOn 15 December 2021, Modrić tested positive for COVID-19.[392]\\n\\nLegal issues\\nIn March 2018, in an embezzlement and tax evasion trial against the former Dinamo Zagreb executive, Zdravko Mamić, Modrić was called as a witness.[393] Throughout the mid-late 2000s, Modrić signed multiple contracts with Mamić to play at Dinamo Zagreb.[394][395] Modrić annexed most of his Tottenham transfer fee to Mamić because he was the broker of the move and gave Modrić financial backing early on in his career.[396][397] Despite stating in 2017 that he signed the annexe clause of the contract ten years earlier, in his testimony he stated that he signed it in 2004, the year of his first contract. Modrić was charged with perjury for stating that he annexed his fee at an earlier date than he allegedly had.[393] Facing the judge, he said, \"I came here to state my defence and tell the truth, like every time so far. My conscience is clear\".[395][398] The Croatian Football Federation stood behind Modrić,[395] but a part of the Croatian public, frustrated with the corruption in Croatian football, perceived the alleged perjury as a defence of Mamić and became critical of Modrić.[399][400][401] Some international news outlets praised him for dealing with the stress of his legal situation while performing with the Croatian team at the 2018 FIFA World Cup.[402] In October and December 2018, the perjury charge was rejected by the Croatian courts.[403][404]\\n\\nCareer statistics\\nClub\\nAs of match played 30

He is often regarded to be one of the best defensive midfielders in world football.[5][6][7][8][9][10][11]\\nFormed at São Paulo, where he scored 11 goals in 112 official games, Casemiro moved to Real Madrid in 2013, and also spent a season on loan at Porto. He was part of the Real Madrid squad that won four Champions League titles in five seasons, from 2014 to 2018. In total he has won fourteen major trophies at Real Madrid, including four UEFA Champions League, two La Liga, one Copa del Rey and three FIFA Club World Cup trophies. \\nA full international since 2011, Casemiro was in Brazil\\'s squad at the 2018 FIFA World Cup as well as four Copa América tournaments, winning the 2019 edition.[12]\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 Club career\\n\\n1.1 São Paulo\\n1.2 Real Madrid\\n\\n\\n2 International career\\n3 Style of play\\n4 Personal life\\n5 Career statistics\\n\\n5.1 Club\\n5.2 International\\n\\n\\n6 Honours\\n7 References\\n8 External links\\n\\n\\nClub career[edit]\\nSão Paulo[edit]\\nBorn in São José dos Campos, São Paulo, Casemiro was a product of São Paulo FC\\'s youth system. From the age of 11 upwards, he acted as captain to its sides;[13][14] he was known as \"Carlão\" – an augmentative form of his first name in Portuguese – early on, and would be called up for the 2009 FIFA U-17 World Cup.[15]\\nCasemiro made his Série A debut on 25 July 2010, in an away loss against Santos FC. He scored his first goal as a professional on 15 August, helping to a 2–2 draw with Cruzeiro Esporte Clube.[16]\\nOn 7 April 2012, Casemiro scored the first goal of a 2–0 win over Mogi Mirim Esporte Clube at the Arena Barueri in that year\\'s Campeonato Paulista after replacing the injured Fabrício early on, but was later sent off.[17] São Paulo also won the Copa Sudamericana, with the player making one substitute appearance in a 5–0 home success against Club Universidad de Chile in the quarter-final second leg on 7 November.[18]\\n\\nReal Madrid[edit]\\n Casemiro playing for Real Madrid in 2015\\nIn late January 2013, Casemiro was loaned to Real Madrid in Spain, being assigned to the B-team in Segunda División.[19] He played his first game in the competition on 16 February, starting in a 1–3 defeat at CE Sabadell FC.[20]\\nCasemiro made his La Liga debut on 20 April 2013, playing the full 90 minutes in a 3–1 home win over Real Betis.[21] On 2 June he scored his first goal in Europe, opening the reserves\\' 4–0 win over AD Alcorcón at the Alfredo di Stéfano Stadium;[22] eight days later, the move was made permanent for four years and a fee of R$18.738\\xa0million.[23][24][25]\\nCasemiro was loaned to FC Porto on 19 July 2014, in a season-long loan.[26] He totalled 40 games overall for the Portuguese, netting four times[27] including a free kick on 10 March 2015 in a 4–0 home win (5–1 aggregate) over FC Basel in the last 16 of the UEFA Champions League.[28]\\nOn 5 June 2015, Casemiro returned to Real Madrid who activated his buyback clause,[29] and two months later his contract was extended until 2021.[30] On 13 March of the following year, he scored his first competitive goal for the Merengues, heading home an 89th-minute corner kick by Jesé in a 2–1 victory at UD Las Palmas.[31]\\nAfter being mostly a reserve player under Rafael Benítez, Casemiro became first-choice under his successor Zinedine Zidane,[32] and contributed with 11 appearances in the season\\'s Champions League as the tournament ended in a win. In the final against Atlético Madrid, he featured the full 120 minutes in a 1–1 draw in Milan (penalty shootout triumph).[33]\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ahhh, Casimiro. He saved my life. I might play until I\\'m 45 with this guy by my side.\"\\n\\n\\n—Marcelo for The Players\\' Tribune[34]\\n\\n\\nCasemiro scored four goals in 25 matches in the 2016–17 campaign, helping his team win the national championship for the first time in five years.[35][36] He scored a long-range strike in the Champions League final against Juventus FC, helping his side to a 4–1 victory;[37] he again found the net on 8 August 2017, putting his team ahead in an eventual 2–1 defeat of Manchester United for the UEFA Super Cup.[38]\\nDuring the 2017–18 Champions League, Casemiro made 13 appearances while scoring one goal,[39] when Madrid won their third consecutive and 13th overall title in the competition.[40]\\nHe was a regular starter during the league season, as Real Madrid won the 2019–20 La Liga.[41]\\nIn August 2021, he extended his contract until 2025.[42]\\n\\nInternational career[edit]\\n Casemiro playing for Brazil\\nAfter appearing with the under-20s at the 2011 South American Championship and the 2011 World Cup,[43] Casemiro made his debut for the Brazil senior side on 14 September 2011, in a 0–0 draw against Argentina, aged just 19.[44] He was named by manager Dunga in the Brazilian squad for the 2015 Copa América, but did not play any matches in the quarter-final exit in Chile.[45]\\nOn 5 May 2016, he was named among the 23-man list for the Copa América Centenario to be held in the United States.[46]\\nIn May 2018, Casemiro was selected by manager Tite for the upcoming edition of the FIFA World Cup in Russia.[47] He made his debut in the competition on 17 June, playing 60 minutes in a 1–1 group stage draw to Switzerland.[48]\\nIn May 2019, he was included in Brazil\\'s 23-man squad for the 2019 Copa América on home soil.[49] In the final group game at the Arena Corinthians against Peru, he scored his first international goal to open a 5–0 victory, but was also sent off for two yellow cards and suspended from the next match.[50] He started in Brazil\\'s 3–1 victory over Peru in the 2019 Copa América Final on 7 July, at the Maracanã Stadium.[51]\\nHe was named to the 2021 Copa América squad on 9 June 2021.[52]\\n\\nStyle of play[edit]\\n\\n\\n\"For the balance of the team, he is without a doubt [Real Madrid\\'s] most important player ... He has changed the face of Madrid.\"\\n\\n\\n—Atlético Madrid manager Diego Simeone before the 2016 UEFA Champions League Final[53]\\n\\n\\nCasemiro mainly plays as a defensive midfielder,[54] although he has also been deployed in a box-to-box role in the centre of the pitch,[55][56] or even as a centre-back on occasion.[57] While he is not particularly talented or skilful from a technical standpoint[58][59][60] (although he was able to improve in this area under manager Zinedine Zidane during their time at Real Madrid together),[61] Casemiro is an intelligent, physically strong, mobile, aggressive, and hard-tackling midfielder, with an extremely high work-rate.[61][56][62][63] While he is mainly known for his ability to provide balance to his teams by supporting his more offensive-minded teammates defensively, and distributing the ball to them accurately after winning back possession, he is also a well-rounded midfielder, who possesses a powerful shot from outside the penalty area, and reliable distribution, as well as an ability to get forward with his runs off the ball, or start attacks with his passing; these characteristics also enable him to contribute offensively, or even score goals, in addition to breaking up plays.[56][64][65][66][67][68] Moreover, his quick reactions, as well as his excellent positional sense, ability to read the game, and good anticipation, enable him to excel in a holding midfield role in front of the defence, by cutting out counter-attacks and shielding the back-line.[56][61][69][70][71] Often described as a \"destroyer\" in the media,[72] he has drawn praise from pundits for his energetic and combative style of play,[73][74][75] as well as his tactical awareness and abilities as a ball winner, which enable him to cover ground, track back, and press opponents.[64][68][70][76][77][78] His tenacity on the pitch, exemplified by his fierce challenges and stamina,[79] have led Marca to nickname him \"The Tank.\"[80] In addition to his footballing abilities, he also stands out for his competitive spirit, mentality, consistency, and determination on the pitch.[61][81] Despite maintaining a good disciplinary record, he has, however, also come into criticism in the media at times over his excessively aggressive challenges on the pitch.[82] Casemiro\\'s playing style has drawn comparisons with that of former Real Madrid defensive midfielder Claude Makélélé,[61] as well as compatriot Toninho Cerezo.[66]\\n\\nPersonal life[edit]\\nCasemiro featured in a promotional trailer for FIFA 19.[83]\\nOn 7 November 2020, he tested positive for COVID-19.[84]\\n\\nCareer statistics[edit]\\nClub[edit]\\nAs of match played 30 April 2022[12][85]\\n\\n\\nClub\\n\\nSeason\\n\\nLeague\\n\\nState League\\n\\nNational

He most recently coached Spanish club Real Madrid and is one of the most successful coaches in the world. Also widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Zidane was a playmaker renowned for his elegance, vision, passing, ball control and technique. He received many individual accolades as a player, including being named FIFA World Player of the Year in 1998, 2000 and 2003, and winning the 1998 Ballon d\\'Or.\\nZidane started his career at Cannes before establishing himself as one of the best players in the French Ligue 1 at Bordeaux. In 1996, he moved to Italian team Juventus, where he won trophies including two Serie A titles. He moved to Real Madrid for a world record fee at the time of €77.5\\xa0million in 2001, which remained unmatched for the next eight years. In Spain, Zidane won several trophies, including a La Liga title and the UEFA Champions League. In the 2002 Champions League Final, he scored a left-foot volleyed winner which is considered to be one of the greatest goals in the competition\\'s history.\\nCapped 108 times by France, Zidane won the 1998 FIFA World Cup, scoring twice in the final, and was named to the All-Star Team. This triumph made him a national hero in France and he received the Legion of Honour in 1998. He won UEFA Euro 2000 and was named Player of the Tournament. He also received the Golden Ball for Player of the Tournament at the 2006 World Cup, despite his infamous sending off in the final against Italy for headbutting Marco Materazzi in the chest. He retired as the fourth-most capped player in French history.\\nIn 2004, he was named in the FIFA 100, a list of the world\\'s greatest living players compiled by Pelé, and in the same year was named the best European footballer of the past 50 years in the UEFA Golden Jubilee Poll. Zidane is one of eight players to have won the World Cup, the Champions League and the Ballon d\\'Or. He was the ambassador for Qatar\\'s successful bid to stage the 2022 World Cup, the first Arab country to host the tournament.\\nAfter retiring as a player, Zidane began his coaching career at Real Madrid Castilla. He remained in the position for two years before taking the helm of the first team in 2016. In his initial two and a half seasons, Zidane became the first coach to win the Champions League three times consecutively, won the UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup twice each, as well as a La Liga title and a Supercopa de España. This success led to Zidane being named Best FIFA Men\\'s Coach in 2017. He resigned in 2018, but returned to the club as coach in 2019 and proceeded to win another La Liga and Supercopa de España title. He left the club once again in 2021.\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 Early life and career\\n2 Club career\\n\\n2.1 Cannes\\n2.2 Bordeaux\\n2.3 Juventus\\n2.4 Real Madrid\\n\\n\\n3 International career\\n\\n3.1 Euro 1996\\n3.2 1998 World Cup\\n3.3 Euro 2000\\n3.4 2002 World Cup\\n3.5 Euro 2004\\n3.6 2006 World Cup\\n\\n\\n4 Retirement\\n\\n4.1 Charity activities\\n\\n\\n5 Coaching career\\n\\n5.1 Real Madrid Castilla\\n5.2 Real Madrid\\n5.3 Return to Real Madrid\\n\\n\\n6 Reception and legacy\\n\\n6.1 As a player\\n6.2 As a coach\\n\\n\\n7 In popular culture\\n8 Personal life\\n9 Career statistics\\n\\n9.1 Club\\n9.2 International\\n\\n\\n10 Managerial statistics\\n11 Honours\\n\\n11.1 Player\\n11.2 Manager\\n11.3 Orders\\n11.4 Records\\n\\n11.4.1 As a player\\n11.4.2 As a manager\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n12 See also\\n13 Notes\\n14 References\\n15 External links\\n\\n\\nEarly life and career\\n La Castellane in the northwestern edge of Marseille where Zidane was born in 1972\\n La Corniche, seaside roadway along the coast of Marseille, with a mural of Zidane on the wall\\nZinedine Yazid Zidane was born on 23 June 1972 in La Castellane, Marseille, in Southern France.[4] He is the youngest of five siblings. Zidane is a Muslim of Algerian Kabyle descent.[5][6] His parents, Smaïl and Malika, emigrated to Paris from the village of Aguemoune in the Berber-speaking region of Kabylie in northern Algeria in 1953 before the start of the Algerian War. The family, which had settled in the city\\'s tough northern districts of Barbès and Saint-Denis, found little work in the region, and in the mid-1960s moved to the northern Marseille suburb of La Castellane in the 16th arrondissement of Marseille.[7]\\n\\nI have an affinity with the Arabic world. I have it in my blood, via my parents. I’m very proud of being French, but also very proud of having these roots and this diversity.—\\u2009Zidane interview with Esquire magazine.[8]\\nHis father worked as a warehouseman and nightwatchman at a department store, often on the night shift, while his mother was a housewife.[5] The family lived a reasonably comfortable life by the standards of the neighbourhood, which was notorious throughout Marseille for its high crime and unemployment rates.[6][9] Zidane credits his strict upbringing and his father as the \"guiding light\" in his career.[8]\\nIt was in Castellane where Zidane had his earliest introduction in football, joining in at the age of five in football games that the neighbourhood\\'s children played on the Place Tartane, an 80-by-12-yard plaza that served as the main square of the housing complex.[10] In July 2011, Zidane named former Marseille players Blaž Slišković, Enzo Francescoli and Jean-Pierre Papin as his idols while growing up.[11][12] At the age of ten, Zidane got his first player\\'s licence after joining the junior team of a local club from Castellane by the name of US Saint-Henri.[13] After spending a year and a half at US Saint-Henri, Zidane joined SO Septèmes-les-Vallons when the Septèmes coach Robert Centenero convinced the club\\'s Director to get Zidane.[13] Zidane stayed with Septèmes until the age of 14, at which time he was selected to attend a three-day training camp at the CREPS (Regional Centre for Sports and Physical Education) in Aix-en-Provence, one of several such footballing institutes run by the French Football Federation. It was here that Zidane was spotted by AS Cannes scout and former player Jean Varraud, who recommended him to the training centre director of the club.[14] As a 14-year-old watching the 1986 World Cup, the performance of Diego Maradona left an indelible mark on him, with Zidane stating Maradona \"was on another level\".[15]\\n\\nClub career\\nCannes\\n\\n\\n\"He’d go past one, two, three, five, six players – it was sublime. His feet spoke with the ball\"\\n\\n\\n—Jean Varraud, former player who discovered Zidane.[14]\\n\\n\\nZidane went to AS Cannes for a six-week stay, but ended up remaining at the club for four years to play at the professional level. Having left his family to join Cannes, he was invited by Cannes Director Jean-Claude Elineau to leave the dormitory he shared with 20 other trainees and to come and stay with him and his family. Zidane later said that while living with the Elineaus he found equilibrium.[5]\\nIt was at Cannes where Zidane\\'s first coaches noticed that he was raw and sensitive, prone to attack spectators who insulted his race or family.[16] His first coach, Jean Varraud, encouraged him to channel his anger and focus on his own game. Zidane spent his first weeks at Cannes mainly on cleaning duty as a punishment for punching an opponent who mocked his ghetto origins.[16] The occasional violence that he would display throughout his career was shaped by an internal conflict of being an Algerian-Frenchman suspended between cultures, and surviving the tough streets of La Castellane where he grew up.[16]\\nZidane made his professional debut with Cannes on 18 May 1989 in a French Division 1 match against Nantes.[17] He scored his first goal for the club on 10 February 1991[18] also against Nantes in a 2–1 win. After the match during a party for all the Cannes players, Zidane was given a car by Cannes chairman Alain Pedretti, who had promised him one the day he scored his first goal for the club.[19] On the pitch, Zidane displayed extraordinary technique on the ball, offering glimpses of the talent that would take him to the top of the world game.[14] In his first full season with Cannes, the club secured its first ever European football berth by qualifying for the UEFA Cup after finishing fourth in the league. This remains the club\\'s highest finish in the top flight since getting relegated for the first time from the first division in the 1948–49 season.[20]\\n\\nBordeaux\\nZidane was transferred to Girondins de Bordeaux in the 1992–93 season, winning the 1995 Intertoto Cup after beating Karlsruhe[21][22] and finishing runner-up against Bayern Munich in the 1995–96 UEFA Cup[22][23][24] during his four years with the club. He played a set of midfield combinations with Bixente Lizarazu and Christophe Dugarry, which would become the trademark of both Bordeaux and the 1998 French national team. In 1995, Blackburn Rovers manager Kenny Dalglish had expressed interest in signing both Zidane and Dugarry, to which club owner Jack Walker reportedly replied, \"Why do you want to sign Zidane when we have Tim Sherwood?\"[25] Also towards the beginning of the 1996 season, according to football agent Barry Silkman, Zidane was offered to Newcastle United for £1.2\\xa0million, but the club turned down the offer after watching him, claiming that he was not good enough for the English First Division.[26] In 1996, Zidane received the award for Ligue 1 Player of the Year.[27]\\n\\nJuventus\\n\\n\\n\"He is a special player. He creates space where there is none. No matter where he gets the ball or how it comes to him, he can get out of trouble. His imagination and his technique are amazing\"\\n\\n\\n—Juventus teammate Edgar Davids on Zidane\\'s ability.[28]\\n\\n\\nAfter a series of stand out performances for both Bordeaux and France, Zidane had offers to join Europe\\'s top clubs in the spring of 1996, deciding on a move to UEFA Champions League winners Juventus during the close season.[29] Zidane\\'s impact in Italy was immediate, winning the 1996–97 Serie A title and the 1996 Intercontinental Cup.[30] He was named Serie A Foreign Footballer of the Year in his first season.[31] Zidane\\'s growing status in the sport saw him chosen in a European XI to face a World XI – featuring a forward line of Ronaldo and Gabriel Batistuta – in December 1997.[32]\\nAs the playmaker at Juve, Zidane played just behind forward Alessandro Del Piero, with Del Piero recalling, \"Zidane had an extraordinary talent, which contributed to his sole interest in helping the team. He was not a selfish player. He had a unique ability to be a great and to be a team player. I was lucky to play with him.\"[33] He lost in the 1997 UEFA Champions League Final 3–1 to Borussia Dortmund when he was unable to make an impression against the close marking of Paul Lambert.[34]\\nThe following season, Zidane scored seven goals in 32 matches in the league to help Juventus win the 1997–98 Serie A and thus retain the Scudetto. In Europe, Juventus made their third consecutive UEFA Champions League Final appearance, but lost the game 1–0 to Real Madrid. In 1998, Zidane was named FIFA World Player of the Year, and won the Ballon d\\'Or. Juventus finished second in the 2000–01 Serie A, but were eliminated in the group stage of the Champions League, after Zidane was banned for head-butting Hamburger SV player Jochen Kientz.[35] In 2001, Zidane was named Serie A Foreign Footballer of the Year for the second time.[31]\\n\\nReal Madrid\\n Zidane with teammate David Beckham in 2003\\nIn 2001, Zidane joined Real Madrid for a world record fee of 150\\xa0billion Italian lire,[36][37] (about €77.5\\xa0million by fixed exchange rate; a reported 12.8\\xa0billion pesetas[38]) in instalments,[39] and signed a four-year contract. The latest addition to the Galácticos era of global stars signed by Real Madrid every year, in his first season at the club Zidane scored a famous match-winning goal, a volley hit with his weaker left foot from the edge of the 18-yard box, in Madrid\\'s 2–1 win over Bayer Leverkusen in the 2002 UEFA Champions League Final.[40][41] The goal has been cited as one of the greatest in Champions League history.[40][42][43] The magnitude of the strike saw Zidane produce one of his most emotional goal celebrations as he ran towards the touchline with mouth wide open, screaming in delight.[44]\\n\\nZinedine Zidane, 18 yards out, watching and waiting, adjusts his body and, in one, smooth movement, pirouettes and catches it full on the volley with his left foot. It flies past Hans-Jorg Butt. It was the moment of Zidane\\'s apotheosis, more so than the 1998 World Cup final, because of the moment\\'s grace and beauty, because of his control of everything around him. He was Bruce Lee in slow motion while kung-fu chaos reigned around.—\\u2009Rory Smith in The Telegraph, Top 20 sporting moments of the decade: Zinedine Zidane\\'s Champions League final winner.[40]\\n\\n\\n\"He dominates the ball, he is a walking spectacle and he plays as if he had silk gloves on each foot. He makes it worthwhile going to the stadium – he\\'s one of the best I have ever seen.\"\\n\\n\\n—Alfredo Di Stéfano on Zidane after he was named World Player of the Year in 2003.[45]\\n\\n\\nThe next season, Zidane helped Real Madrid to win the 2002–03 La Liga, starring alongside Luís Figo in midfield, and was named the FIFA World Player of the Year for the third time.[46] In 2004, fans voted him as the best European footballer of the previous 50 years in UEFA\\'s fiftieth-anniversary Golden Jubilee Poll.[47]\\nWhile Zidane\\'s final season of club football ended without a trophy, he enjoyed success on a personal note by scoring his first hat-trick, against Sevilla, in a 4–2 win in January 2006.[48] He ended the season for Real Madrid as their second highest goalscorer and assists provider behind teammates Ronaldo and David Beckham respectively, with nine goals and ten assists in 28 games.[49] On 7 May 2006, Zidane, who had announced his plans to retire after the 2006 World Cup,[50] played his farewell match and scored in a 3–3 draw with Villarreal. The squad wore commemorative shirts with ZIDANE 2001–2006 below the club logo. The 80,000 fans inside the Santiago Bernabéu held up a banner reading, \"Thanks for the magic.\"[14]\\nIn 2012, Zidane featured for Madrid in an All Stars Match against Manchester United which resulted in a 3–2 win for Real. In April 2013, he was named by Marca as a member of the \"Best foreign eleven in Real Madrid\\'s history.\"[51]\\n\\nInternational career\\nBoth France and Algeria consider Zidane a citizen. It was rumoured that coach Abdelhamid Kermali denied Zidane a position for the Algerian squad because he felt the young midfielder was not fast enough.[52] However, Zidane dismissed the rumour in a 2005 interview, saying that he would have been ineligible to play for Algeria because he had already played for France.[53]\\nZidane was a member of the French under-21 squad that won a bronze medal at the 1993 Mediterranean Games in Languedoc-Roussillon.[54]\\nHe earned his first cap with France as a substitute in a friendly against the Czech Republic on 17 August 1994, which ended in a 2–2 draw after Zidane scored twice to help France erase a 2–0 deficit. After Eric Cantona was handed a year-long suspension in January 1995 for assaulting a fan, Zidane took over the playmaker position.[55]\\n\\nEuro 1996\\nDespite not being at his best during the tournament, France reached the last four. Zidane was not yet fully established in the French team and his level was quite average during the whole event, but he managed to score in the penalty shootout in both the quarter-final and semi-final. France was eliminated in the Euro 96 semi-finals in a penalty shootout against the Czech Republic.[56]\\n\\n1998 World Cup\\n Following France\\'s World Cup win, an image of Zidane was projected on the Arc de Triomphe (pictured) along with the words \"Merci Zizou\".[57]\\nThe 1998 FIFA World Cup was the first World Cup that Zidane participated in; the tournament was held in his home country, France. The French team won all three games in the group stage, with Zidane setting up Christophe Dugarry\\'s goal in the opening match against South Africa from a corner, and contributing to Thierry Henry\\'s opening goal in the second match against Saudi Arabia; however, Zidane was sent off in the latter match for a stamp on Fuad Anwar, becoming the first French player to receive a red card in a World Cup Finals match.[58] Without their playmaker, France proceeded to win 1–0 in the round of sixteen game against Paraguay and, on his return to the side, defeated Italy 4–3 on penalties after a goalless draw in the quarter-finals, with Zidane netting the first spot kick in the shoot-out.[59] France then defeated Croatia 2–1 in the semi-final. Although Zidane had played a role in the team\\'s accomplishments, he had yet to score a goal at the World Cup.[58][60]\\nZidane and France went on to play against defending champions and favourites Brazil at the Stade de France in the 1998 FIFA World Cup Final. France dominated Brazil from the kick-off, with Zidane scoring two similar goals, both headers from corner kicks taken by Emmanuel Petit and Youri Djorkaeff. Courtesy of Zidane\\'s two goals, France went into the half-time break 2–0 up with one hand on the World Cup trophy.[14] Petit added a third goal deep in stoppage time to seal the 3–0 win and France\\'s first ever World Cup. Named man of the match, Zidane became an instant national hero and would receive the Legion of Honour later that year.[57] More than one million people lined the Champs-Élysées in Paris, with celebrations centred around the Arc de Triomphe.[61][62]\\n\\nEuro 2000\\n Zidane\\'s France jersey from Euro 2000\\nTwo years later France won Euro 2000, becoming the first team to hold both the World Cup and the European Championship since West Germany in 1974. Zidane finished with two goals, a bending free kick against Spain in the quarter-final and the golden goal in the semi-final against Portugal with a penalty.[63][64] UEFA named Zidane Player of the Tournament.[65]\\nZidane himself believes he was at his peak during the tournament, while the UEFA website states, \"In Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane dominated a major championship in a way no individual had managed since Diego Maradona in 1986. From the opening game against Denmark to the final against Italy, \\'Zizou\\' shone brightly, casting a spell on his opponents with clever flicks, mesmerising stepovers, slaloming runs and masterful vision.\"[66]\\n\\n2002 World Cup\\nAs reigning world and European champions, France entered the 2002 World Cup in Japan/Korea as favourites but a thigh injury sustained in a warm up match before the tournament prevented Zidane from playing in France\\'s first two matches and without their talisman, the French team failed to score in either match. He was rushed back prematurely for the third game despite not being fully fit, but could not prevent France from being ignominiously eliminated in the group stage without scoring a single goal; the worst performance by a defending champion in the history of the competition.[67]\\n\\nEuro 2004\\nAt Euro 2004, France topped their group with wins over England and Switzerland, before being knocked out in the quarter finals by eventual champions Greece in a surprise 1–0 loss.[68] In the opening match against England, Zidane scored a free kick and penalty in stoppage time to turn impending defeat into a 2–1 victory.[69][70] After France\\'s elimination, Zidane announced his retirement from international football.[71]\\n\\n2006 World Cup\\n Zidane during the 2006 World Cup Final\\nWith the mass retirement of veteran key players such as Bixente Lizarazu, Marcel Desailly, Claude Makélélé and Lilian Thuram, France struggled to qualify for the 2006 World Cup. At the urging of coach Raymond Domenech, Zidane came out of retirement and was immediately reinstated as team captain.[72] Zidane, along with Thuram and Makélélé, made his competitive return for France in a 3–0 win over the Faroe Islands on 3 September 2005. The trio helped France rise from fourth place to win their qualifying group.[73] On 27 May 2006, Zidane earned his hundredth cap for France in a 1–0 friendly win over Mexico, in what would also be his last match at the Stade de France. Zidane became France\\'s fourth player to reach 100 caps, after Desailly, Thuram and Didier Deschamps.[74]\\nFrance had a slow start to the 2006 Finals and, after being suspended for the third match of the group stage, Zidane returned to set up a goal for Patrick Vieira and score one himself in the second round match against Spain.[75] In the quarter-final France held Brazil to just one shot on goal in the rematch of the 1998 final. Zidane assisted Thierry Henry\\'s deciding goal and was named Man of the Match by FIFA.[76][77] France faced Portugal in the semi-final and, as in Brussels six years earlier, Zidane\\'s penalty kick decided the contest and sent France to another major final.[78][79]\\nHaving already announced he was to retire after the expiration of his Real Madrid contract at the end of the 2005–06 season, the world of football already knew Zidane\\'s second World Cup final was to be the last match of his career. Seven minutes into the 2006 World Cup final in Berlin, Zidane put France ahead with a Panenka-style penalty kick which struck the crossbar and bounced just over the goal line[80] to become only the fourth player in World Cup history to score in two different finals, along with Pelé, Paul Breitner, and Vavá, in addition to being tied for first place with Vavá, Pelé and Geoff Hurst with three World Cup final goals apiece. He almost scored a second goal during the first period of extra time but his header was saved by Italy\\'s goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon. Zidane was then sent off in the 110th minute of the game after headbutting Marco Materazzi in the chest,[81][82] so he did not participate in the penalty shootout which Italy won 5–3.[83] This marked the 14th overall expulsion of Zidane\\'s career, and joined him with Cameroon\\'s Rigobert Song as the only players ever to be sent off during two separate World Cup tournaments.[84] He also became the fourth player red-carded in a World Cup final, in addition to being the first sent off in extra time.[85] Zidane\\'s actions made headlines all over the world, while in France Le Figaro called his head-butt \"odious\", and the front page of L\\'Equipe asked, \"What should we tell our children, for whom you have become an example for ever? ... How could that happen to a man like you?\"[79] Zidane had received plaudits for his performances during the tournament, with Pep Guardiola writing he exerts so much influence on the team that \"France are never disorganised\".[86] The day after the final, Zidane was awarded the Golden Ball as the player of the tournament.[87]\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The match you played last night was full of talent and professionalism. I know that you are sad and disappointed but what I want to tell you is that the whole country is extremely proud of you. You have honoured the country with your exceptional qualities and your fantastic fighting spirit, which was your strength in difficult times, but also in winning times.\"\\n\\n\\n—President of France, Jacques Chirac, pays tribute to Zidane in Paris after the 2006 World Cup.[79]\\n\\n\\nUpon his return to France, the Place de la Concorde in Paris was filled with thousands of fans waving flags and rhythmically chanting \"Zizou! Zizou!\", and tributes were led by the French president Jacques Chirac.[79] Chirac\\'s words reflected the feeling of the French public, with polls done in the immediate wake of the incident showing support for Zidane: 61% of French people said they had already forgiven him for his actions while 52% said they understood them.[79] According to French journalist Philippe Auclair, Zidane\\'s performances in the knock-out rounds were \"ranked among his finest in a blue shirt.\"[79] As the player of the tournament, Zidane had given the team hope, with the French daily newspaper Libération stating, \"For a month, France was dreaming with Zidane.\"[79] Zidane remained an icon to the French public, and one French writer stated, \"It\\'s good for us to see our national hero is fallible.\"[79] It was later revealed through interviews that Marco Materazzi had insulted Zidane\\'s sister, which led to Zidane\\'s heightened anger and reaction.[88] In 2010, Zidane said that he would \"rather die than apologize\" to Materazzi for the headbutt in the final,[89] but also admitted that he \"could never have lived with himself\" had he been allowed to remain on the pitch and help France win the match.[90] He later said, \"If you look at the fourteen red cards I had in my career, twelve of them were a result of provocation. This isn\\'t justification, this isn\\'t an excuse, but my passion, temper and blood made me react.\"[91]\\nFollowing his red card in the final, Zidane retired from professional football and confirmed that he would not go back on his decision.[92] He was sentenced by FIFA to a three-match suspension for the red card.[93] He agreed to complete three days of community service with children in one of FIFA\\'s humanitarian projects.[94] Zidane ended up tying with Brazil\\'s Cafu for the record for most cards given in World Cup matches, with six.[95]\\n\\nRetirement\\n Zidane playing a backheel during a game of futsal in 2008\\nSince his retirement, Zidane has regularly played for the Real Madrid Veterans team. He has also made several futsal appearances. In 2015 he played in a futsal tournament in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, during which an opposition player received a yellow card to much amusement for taking an in-match selfie with Zidane.[96] In an interview in June 2008, Zidane stated that he wanted to return to football, but that he had no immediate plans to do so.[97]\\nOn 1 June 2009, Zidane was announced as the advisor to the president after Florentino Pérez was named president of Real Madrid for the second time.[98] He, along with general director Jorge Valdano and sporting director Miguel Pardeza, were to be the key decisionmakers on the sporting side of the club.[98] After France\\'s dismal campaign in the 2010 World Cup, Zidane said that he did not plan to move into coaching any time soon.[99]\\nQatar\\'s 2022 World Cup bid committee announced in September 2010 that Zidane had been appointed as an ambassador for Qatar\\'s attempt to host the 2022 World Cup.[100] After FIFA announced on 2 December 2010 that Qatar had won the bid to host the 2022 World Cup,[101] Zidane stated that he was \"very pleased\" with the outcome.[102] Zidane spoke of the message he was trying to convey in the campaign: \"I was saying that football belonged to the whole world. I’m proud to have made my contribution to a new country getting the World Cup. Qatar and the entire Middle East as a whole deserves this event and that makes me happy. It\\'s a victory for the Arab world.\"[103] Zidane has supported two Olympic bids for Paris, including the 2012 Summer Olympics which was narrowly won by London and later Paris\\' successful bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics. Paris will also be hosting the 2024 Summer Paralympics.[104]\\n\\nCharity activities\\n Zidane at the Danone Nations Cup, 2008. A football tournament involving 2.5\\xa0million children from over 11,000 clubs from around the globe, Zidane is its ambassador.\\nOn 24 February 2007, before a crowd of 10,000 fans at a match in northern Thailand for the Keuydaroon children\\'s AIDS charity, Zidane scored the first goal and set up the second for a Malaysian teammate as the match ended 2–2. The event raised ฿260,000 ($7,750). This money paid for the building of two schools and 16 three-bedroom houses.[105]\\nOn 19 November 2008, Zidane took part in the fifth annual Match Against Poverty in Málaga, Spain, which also ended in a 2–2 draw; he went scoreless but set up his team\\'s second goal. He and Ronaldo, who collaborated in conceiving the yearly event to benefit the United Nations Development Programme, regularly captain their respective teams consisting of active footballers, other professional athletes and celebrities.[106] Zidane, a UN Goodwill Ambassador since 2001, stated before the game that \"everyone can do something to make the world a better place.\"[107]\\n\\n Zidane in the Match Against Poverty in Bern, March 2014\\nIn June and July 2009, Zidane toured across Canada with stops in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. Although billed as Zidane and \"Friends\", the likes of which included Fabien Barthez and Samuel Eto\\'o, the exhibition matches featured local players. Some proceeds were given to UNICEF.[108]\\nOn 6 June 2010, Zidane took part in the biennial charity event Soccer Aid. He played for the Rest of the World team, managed by former Liverpool and Celtic forward Kenny Dalglish against England alongside former Real Madrid teammate Luís Figo and Celtic legend Henrik Larsson. He played against former players such as Teddy Sheringham and Alan Shearer, as well as celebrities such as Hollywood actors Woody Harrelson, Mike Myers, Michael Sheen, chef Gordon Ramsay, actor Damian Lewis and singer Robbie Williams.[109] The match took place at Old Trafford, Manchester and was won by the Rest of the World for the first time, the winning penalty scored by Harrelson after a 2–2 draw.[109]\\nOn 2 June 2013, Zidane took part in a charity match played at Old Trafford as part of the Manchester United Legends vs. Real Madrid Legends reverse fixture. The first leg took place in Santiago Bernabéu Stadium. Part of a team that included the likes of Figo, Fernando Redondo and Manolo Sanchís, the fixture raised funds for the Manchester United Foundation.[110] The 12th Match against Poverty took place in Saint-Étienne, France, on Monday 20 April 2015, where Ronaldo and Zidane teamed up with other football stars against past and present players of French Ligue 1 club AS Saint-Étienne. According to UNDP, \"two-thirds of all proceeds will go towards helping the hardest-hit countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone build back better from the Ebola epidemic.\"[111] In June 2018, Zidane reunited with his France 1998 World Cup winning teammates to play a charity game against an All-Star side which included Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt. In a 3–2 win for France, Thierry Henry played a no-look one-two pass with Zidane before scoring, with Zidane then curling in a 25-yard free kick.[112]\\n\\nCoaching career\\n Zidane in 2013. He was the Real Madrid assistant coach for the 2013–14 season.\\nIn November 2010, Zidane was appointed as a special adviser to Real Madrid\\'s first team in response to an appeal made by then-Real Madrid coach José Mourinho for the former Real midfielder to work more closely with the team. In his new role, Zidane was expected to participate in Champions League events and functions and was also to travel with the first team on a regular basis and participate in pre-match gatherings, training sessions and meetings with the head coach.[113] In July 2011, it was announced that he would become Real Madrid\\'s new sporting director.[114] In 2013, Zidane was appointed assistant coach to Carlo Ancelotti at Real Madrid.[115]\\n\\nReal Madrid Castilla\\nIn June 2014, Real Madrid announced that Zidane would be the coach of Real Madrid\\'s B team, Real Madrid Castilla.[116] On 29 August, the director of the Spanish National Football Coach Education Centre (CENAFE), Miguel Galán, reported Zidane for acting as Real Madrid Castilla\\'s head coach without the necessary coaching badges.[117] According to Galán, \"No one who has anything to do with the football world can be unaware that Zidane is acting as Real Madrid Castilla\\'s head coach this season. It is a fait accompli that has been widely accepted, as shown by media reports, and Real Madrid do not deny it.\"[117] While the official match report for Castilla\\'s opening game in the Segunda División B lists Santiago Sánchez as the Los Blancos\\' head coach and Zidane as his assistant, Galán states, \"This hierarchy only exists on paper. The truth is the exact opposite: Zidane is acting as Real Madrid Castilla\\'s head coach, while, with all due respect to him as a colleague, Mr Sánchez\\'s role basically boils down to providing the badges.\"[117][118]\\n\\nReal Madrid\\n Zidane (right) with Real Madrid captain Sergio Ramos lifting the 2016 UEFA Champions League trophy\\nOn 4 January 2016, Real Madrid announced the dismissal of coach Rafael Benítez and on the same day Zidane was appointed the new coach of the club on a two-and-a-half-year deal.[119] His first match as the club\\'s new manager took place five days later, when Real Madrid beat Deportivo La Coruña 5–0 in a La Liga match. In his first El Clásico as a coach, held on 2 April at the Camp Nou, Zidane led his club to a 2–1 win over Barcelona to end Barça\\'s 39-match unbeaten run.[120]\\nOn 4 May, Zidane led Real Madrid to a place in the 2016 UEFA Champions League Final by beating Manchester City 1–0 on aggregate.[121] In La Liga, Real Madrid finished runners up, just one point behind Barcelona. In the Champions League final on 28 May, Real Madrid defeated fellow Madrid club Atlético Madrid in a penalty shootout to grab the 11th European Cup (La Undécima) in club history. Zidane became the seventh man to win the European Cup (now UEFA Champions League) both as a player and a coach and the second man (after Miguel Muñoz) to win the trophy with Real Madrid as both a player and a coach, and the first French coach, except the French-Argentinian Helenio Herrera, to win the trophy.[122][123]\\n\\n Zidane, with his Real Madrid players, standing to the right of Madrid mayor Manuela Carmena after Real had won their 33rd La Liga title, May 2017\\nIn his first full-season as coach, Real Madrid recorded a club-record 16th consecutive La Liga victory by defeating Espanyol 2–0 away on 18 September 2016, overtaking their previous record of 15 set in 1960–61 and equalling the record of consecutive La Liga wins of Barcelona set in 2010–11.[124] On 18 December, Real Madrid defeated Japanese club Kashima Antlers 4–2 in the final of the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup, with Cristiano Ronaldo scoring a hat-trick.[125]\\nOn 12 January 2017, Madrid\\'s draw against Sevilla FC in the second leg of the Copa del Rey round of 16 saw him win his 40th consecutive match without a loss – creating a new Spanish record, beating Luis Enrique\\'s record of 39 matches undefeated with Barcelona.[126][127] Zidane later led Madrid to the La Liga title, their 33rd in history, by defeating Málaga 2–0.[128]\\nOn 3 June 2017, Zidane led Real Madrid to a 4–1 win against Italian side Juventus in the 2017 UEFA Champions League Final at Cardiff to grab the club\\'s 12th European Cup (La Duodécima). This victory meant that Madrid were the first ever team to win the Champions League back-to-back, as well as recording Zidane\\'s first double as coach, and the club\\'s first since 1956–57.[129] With Real\\'s Champions League victory, Zidane became only the second manager to win the European Cup in his first two seasons in management, alongside fellow Real Madrid coach José Villalonga.[130]\\nHe later won the 2017 UEFA Super Cup 2–1 against Manchester United on 8 August.[131] This meant Zidane was the first manager to win two UEFA Super Cups in a row since Arrigo Sacchi\\'s Milan in 1990. Five days later, Real Madrid beat Barcelona at the Camp Nou 1–3 in the first leg of the 2017 Supercopa de España. Three days later, Real won the second leg 2–0, 5–1 on aggregate, while ending Barcelona\\'s consecutive scoring record in El Clásico.[132] This title tied Zidane with Vicente del Bosque as the third most successful Real Madrid coach with 7 titles, one short of Luis Molowny, but still 7 away from Miguel Muñoz. This also meant, that at the time, Zidane had won as many titles in his coaching position in Real Madrid as games lost during his tenure. Zidane\\'s success saw him named Best FIFA Men\\'s Coach in 2017.[133] In December 2017, Zidane won his eighth trophy as coach when Real defeated Grêmio in the 2017 FIFA Club World Cup in the United Arab Emirates.[134] On 26 May, Zidane won the Champions League for the third time in a row, beating Liverpool 3–1 in the final. He became one of three managers, alongside Bob Paisley and Carlo Ancelotti, to win the European Cup three times, while also becoming the first coach to win the trophy in three consecutive seasons.[135]\\nOn 31 May, five days after the Champions League final, Zidane announced his resignation as Real Madrid coach, citing the club\\'s \"need for change\" as his rationale for departing.[136][137]\\n\\nReturn to Real Madrid\\nFollowing some poor results for Real Madrid in the months following Zidane\\'s departure – culminating in elimination from the Copa del Rey\\'s semi-final stage at home to Barcelona, a league loss to the same opponent at the same venue which opened up a 12-point gap between the clubs, and an unexpected home 4–1 defeat to Ajax in the Champions League which brought the long run of success in that competition to an end, all within the space of a week – his former teammate Santiago Solari (who himself had only been in the post for five months, after Julen Lopetegui\\'s equally brief spell in charge) was dismissed and Zidane returned as the Real Madrid head coach on 11 March 2019, on a contract until summer 2022.[138][139]\\nOn 16 July 2020, Zidane won La Liga for the second time in his coaching career.[140] His collective mindset was hailed by international and Spanish media, as Real Madrid broke several records, including the number of scorers and maintaining their best league defensive record in 30 years, as 21 of his players managed to get on the scoresheet during the 2019–20 La Liga campaign.[141][142] On 27 May 2021, Zidane left Real Madrid for a second time.[143]\\n\\nReception and legacy\\nAs a player\\n\\n\\n\"Zidane is the master.

I don\\'t think anyone can match him when it comes to controlling or receiving the ball.\"\\n\\n\\n—Michel Platini.[145]\\n\\n\\nMany authoritative voices have acclaimed Zidane\\'s skills and importance in the history of football, such as Brazil coach Carlos Alberto Parreira, who called Zidane \"a monster\" for his performance and abilities.[146] German coach Franz Beckenbauer stated, \"Zidane is one of the greatest players in history, a truly magnificent player.\"[146] Italy manager Marcello Lippi, who also coached Zidane, opined, \"I think Zidane is the greatest talent we\\'ve known in football these last twenty years.\"[146] Former England manager Kevin Keegan said, \"You look at Zidane and think \\'I\\'ve never seen a player quite like that.\\' What sets Zidane apart is the way he manipulates a football, buying himself space that isn\\'t there. Add his vision and it makes him very special.\"[147] At the 1998 World Cup, Italian manager Cesare Maldini said, \"I would give up five players to have Zidane in my squad.\"[148]\\n\\nIn terms of ball retention he was probably the greatest player of all time, blessed with such grace and supernatural awareness that he could play a game of real-life Pac-Man and never be caught.—\\u2009Rob Smyth of The Guardian on Zidane\\'s ball control.[149]\\n Zidane\\'s France home jersey from the 2006 World Cup.

When Zidane stepped onto the pitch, the ten other guys just got suddenly better. It is that simple.\"[150] David Beckham has described Zidane as \"the greatest of all time\",[151][152] Barcelona star Xavi has stated in a 2010 interview that Zidane was \"best player in the \\'90s and early 2000s\",[153] while Brazilian defender and former Madrid teammate Roberto Carlos has said of Zidane, \"He is the best player I\\'ve seen. Supporters arrived earlier at the Bernabéu just to see him warm-up.\"[154] Brazilian playmaker Ronaldinho stated, \"Zidane is one of the best footballers of all time, one of my idols. He had such elegance and grace, a wonderful touch and superb vision.\"[155] Belgian playmaker Eden Hazard regards Zidane as \"the best ever\", and growing up he learned from his idol by \"watching him on television and online for hours.\"[156][157]\\nDisplaying skills with an array of moves such as his signature La Roulette pirouette, step overs and close ball control, former Brazilian international Rivaldo stated, \"His elegance of movement on the pitch and his skills are uncanny.\"[158] Journalist Sid Lowe wrote, \"Zidane was football\\'s answer to the Bolshoi Ballet. Zidane was elegance above all else.\"[159] In 2005, upon Zidane\\'s return to the French national team, his teammate Thierry Henry stated, \"In France, everybody realized that God exists, and that he is back in the French international team.\"[160] Zidane has been lauded by sportsmen outside football; having witnessed Zidane\\'s goal against Deportivo La Coruña in January 2002, where he dragged the ball right then left, turning the defender inside out, before scoring with a left foot finish, basketball player Magic Johnson stated, \"One of the most inspiring nights of my life. Zidane is a phenomenon.\"[161]\\nLabelled a \"flawed genius\" by ESPN, Zidane possessed an exceptional first touch, and was also known for his dribbling skills, use of feints, elegance on the ball, and creativity.[162][163][164] He was capable of using either foot, despite being naturally right-footed.[165][166] His technique and co-ordination enabled him to execute shots and volleys with extreme power and precision, in particular from outside the penalty area;[145][167] he was also a free kick and penalty kick specialist.[168][169] A world-class offensive playmaker, Zidane\\'s natural position was in a free role as a classic number 10 behind the strikers.[162][170][171] He was also capable of playing as a second striker,[172][173] or in a more withdrawn role in midfield, either as a central midfielder or deep-lying playmaker, due to his ability to orchestrate his team\\'s attacking plays from deep with his vision and passing.[145][147][174][175] Thus, he was capable of both assisting and scoring goals, despite being neither the most prolific goalscorer nor the most productive creator throughout his career.[176] While not known for his heading ability, his height and physical strength also allowed him to be effective in the air, and saw him score several crucial headers throughout his career.[177] He also drew praise from his managers for his defensive work-rate.[163][178] Despite not being the quickest player, he possessed good agility and acceleration,[163][175][178] as well as exceptional balance and flair on the ball.[179][180] He also had excellent positional sense[177] and outstanding spatial awareness.[181] Although he had a reserved and humble character, his former Juventus managers Lippi and Ancelotti also praised Zidane for being a team player, on whom his teammates could rely.[170] Notwithstanding the acclaim that Zidane received from pundits over his playing ability, he also drew criticism in the media over his temperament and discipline, and for his occasional violent conduct on the pitch, which led to instances in which disciplinary action was taken against him; he was also accused by some in the sport of drifting in and out of games, and of lacking leadership qualities, although he was able to establish himself as a consistent and decisive player, who was also an influential captain at international level throughout his career.[179][182]\\nZidane has been named FIFA World Player of the Year three times, a feat achieved only by Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.[183] In 2002, ESPN described Zidane as \"the greatest player in the world in the world\\'s biggest game\".[161] In a 2002 FIFA poll, Zidane was selected in the FIFA World Cup Dream Team.[184] In 2004, he was voted UEFA Best European Player of the Past 50 Years, and was named in the FIFA 100 list of the world\\'s greatest living players.[185] In a 2004 poll conducted by French newspaper Journal du Dimanche, Zidane was voted as \"the most popular Frenchman of all time\".[179] In 2014, in a poll carried out by French TV channel TF1, Zidane was voted as the best player in the history of the French league.[186] In 2016, in a study led by French newspaper Le Parisien, Zidane was named \"best French player of all time\".[187]\\n\\nAs a coach\\n Zidane at a press conference during the 2017 FIFA Club World Cup. As coach of Real Madrid he won the UEFA Champions League an unprecedented three times consecutively (2016, 2017 and 2018).\\nDespite establishing himself as one of the most successful coaches of his era and in the history of Real Madrid,[A] Zidane\\'s time at Real Madrid was considered by some to be shadowed by a partial amount of luck.[B] However, Zidane\\'s tactical philosophy, particularly his tactical flexibility, has been praised by many.[188][189][190][191] Zidane\\'s tactical style, characterized by its formation flexibility and attacking football, as well as his ability to unite the dressing room, have been positively compared to Carlo Ancelotti\\'s coaching method.[192][193][194] His use of in-game substitutions was particularly praised, as many of his substitutes led to victories, such as introducing Marco Asensio and Lucas Vázquez in order to provide pace and width against Paris Saint-Germain in the UEFA Champions League to overturn a 1–0 deficit into a 3–1 victory. His introduction of Gareth Bale for similar reasons in the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final also reaped similar rewards. It is also noted that his team focused on attacking through the flanks,[195] while he is credited for repopularising the 4–4–2 diamond formation in contemporary football.[196]\\nOn the other hand, some consider that Zidane\\'s role was more focused in grinding out results and uniting the dressing room, rather than having a fixed tactical scheme.[197][198] Zidane emphasised the importance of players\\' physical levels and preferred to choose impactful players over a defined system.[199] During his time at Real Madrid, he used several formations, including the 4–3–3, the 4–2–3–1, the 4–4–2, and the 3–5–2,[200] in order to find the system that best suited his players, and has been credited with using \"simple systems\", \"...so that his players have the freedom needed to prove their superiority.\"[201] As such, although he is not considered to be a tactical innovator, he has been praised for his balanced approach as a coach, and for having the leadership skills and personability to manage and motivate several world class players, create a good team environment, foster professional relationships, and a strong winning mentality; he has also demonstrated an ability to rotate players and get the best out his team, which has played a key role in his success. In 2019 he commented \"You ask me about two players but what interests me is the group. Karim is important for the team, not just for his goals. Casemiro gives a lot of balance, but not only that. Everyone contributes something to the team in their own way on the field\".[202] Regarding his coaching role at Real Madrid, Zidane commented in 2018: \"When you work with high-quality players, they know how to manage those periods of games when you’re not playing well, and they get things back on track very quickly. My job was to keep people calm!\"[203] Two of his main influences as a manager are his own former managers Marcello Lippi and Carlo Ancelotti.[192][204]\\n\\nIn popular culture\\n Zidane\\'s Z5 Group is a sporting complex made up of five a side football pitches sponsored by Adidas\\nZidane has had endorsements with many companies, including Adidas, Lego, France Telecom, Orange, Audi, Volvic and Christian Dior. These sponsorship deals earned him €8.6\\xa0million on top of his €6.4\\xa0million Real Madrid salary in 2006, totalling €15\\xa0million ($20.4\\xa0million), which made him the sixth-highest paid footballer.[205][206] In 2004, Forbes magazine listed his earnings of $15.8\\xa0million for the previous 12 months.[207] In May 2010, Zidane appeared in a commercial for Louis Vuitton, indulging in a game of table football with Pelé and Diego Maradona.[208] Zidane features as the cover star of the Ultimate Edition of the FIFA video game FIFA 20.[209]\\nIn 2005, filmmakers Philippe Parreno and Douglas Gordon filmed a documentary Zidane: A 21st Century Portrait, which follows Zidane during an entire match, filmed with 17 cameras.

Kroos plays mainly as a central midfielder, but has also been deployed as a deep-lying playmaker in his career. Known for his vision, passing, creativity, crossing and set-piece ability,[4][5] Kroos is widely regarded as one of the best midfielders of his generation.[6]\\nKroos began his senior club career playing for Bayern Munich, where he made his debut at age 17 in 2007. He was sparingly used, and opted for an 18-month loan spell at fellow Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen, where he became a key contributor, and returned to his parent club with an increased profile in 2010. With Bayern, Kroos won two consecutive league titles, a UEFA Champions League title, two DFB-Pokal titles, and was voted into the league team of the season three times. In 2014, he joined Real Madrid in a transfer worth €25\\xa0million.[7]\\nIn Madrid, Kroos won thirteen trophies, including two La Liga titles and three UEFA Champions League titles, which he won consecutively from 2016 and 2018, each time being selected in the competition\\'s team of the season. He has been selected in the FIFPro World11 and UEFA Team of the Year three times, and the league\\'s team of the season twice.[8][9] He was voted the IFFHS World\\'s Best Playmaker in 2014 and German Footballer of the Year in 2018.\\nKroos won Golden Player at the 2006 UEFA European Under-17 Championship, where he also finished as top goalscorer, and won the Golden Ball at the 2007 FIFA U-17 World Cup.

Kroos moved to Bayern Munich\\'s youth setup in 2006. Kroos was missing up to 40 days during the school year due to training.[10]\\nFor the 2007–08 season, at the age of 17, Kroos was promoted to Bayern\\'s senior team. He made an astounding start to his Bundesliga career, making his debut for Bayern on 26 September 2007 in a 5–0 defeat of Energie Cottbus and twice assisting Miroslav Klose goals within 18 minutes of his appearance as a substitute.[11] At the time of his debut, Kroos was the youngest player ever to represent Bayern in a professional match at 17\\xa0years, 265\\xa0days old, a record since broken by David Alaba in 2010.[citation needed]\\nOn 25 October, Kroos earned Bayern a valuable victory away to Red Star Belgrade on his UEFA Cup debut, coming on as a substitute in the 81st minute and providing an assist for Miroslav Klose and then scoring the winning goal, his first for the club, in stoppage time.[12] He made his first start for the club in a 3–1 defeat away at VfB Stuttgart.[citation needed]\\nKroos ended his first season with 20 appearances for Bayern, including six starts. He also scored three goals in 12 appearances for Bayern Munich II in the Regionalliga Süd.[citation needed]\\nDespite being selected to start in Bayern\\'s opening 2008–09 Bundesliga match against Hamburger SV, Kroos appeared less frequently for die Roten during the first half of the 2008–09 season. On 5 November 2008, however, he made his UEFA Champions League debut as a 79th-minute substitute against Fiorentina in matchday four of the group stage.[13]\\n\\nLoan at Bayer Leverkusen[edit]\\nOn 31 January 2009, Bayern allowed Kroos to join Bayer Leverkusen on an 18-month loan to gain first team experience.[14] He made his debut on 28 February as a substitute in a 1–0 defeat against Hannover 96. On 12 April, he made his first Bundesliga start for Leverkusen, assisting the team\\'s goal in a 1–1 draw with Werder Bremen. On 18 April 2009, he scored his first Bundesliga goal in a 2–1 loss to VfL Wolfsburg.[citation needed]\\nOn 30 May, Kroos appeared as a late substitute in the 2009 DFB-Pokal Final against Werder Bremen, where Leverkusen were beaten 1–0 by a Mesut Özil goal.[15]\\nDuring the 2008–09 season, Kroos made 13 appearances for Leverkusen in all competitions, scoring once.[citation needed]\\nKroos established himself as a regular in the Leverkusen team in 2009–10, appearing all but one of Bayer\\'s Bundesliga matches. Between matchdays 16 and 20, Kroos registered five goals and four assists in five Bundesliga matches, earning him back-to-back \"player of the month\" awards from kicker for December 2009 and January 2010.[16]\\nHe ended the season with nine goals and 12 assists from 33 matches.[citation needed]\\n\\nBayern Munich[edit]\\nIn the summer of 2010, on the expiration of his loan at Bayer Leverkusen, Kroos returned to Bayern Munich. When asked about his first team chances with Bayern, runner-up in the previous season\\'s Champions League, Kroos stated, \"I want to play as often as possible!\"[17]\\nOn 16 August 2010, he started against Germania Windeck in the first round of the DFB-Pokal, scoring the third goal in a 4–0 victory. On 29 October 2010, he scored his first league goal for the club, in a 4–1 win for the Bavarians against SC Freiburg. During the 2010–11 season, Kroos was a regular starter for Bayern in the Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal and Champions League. He ended the season with 37 appearances in all competitions.[citation needed]\\nDuring 2011–12, under Jupp Heynckes, his former coach at Leverkusen, Kroos established himself as a first choice player from Bayern, forming a strong midfield partnership with national team colleague Bastian Schweinsteiger. He played 51 matches in all competitions during the season, including the 2012 UEFA Champions League Final, where Bayern were beaten on penalties by Chelsea at the Allianz Arena.[citation needed]\\nKroos was an important member of Bayern\\'s treble-winning team during the 2012–13 season. As the most advanced member of a midfield containing Schweinsteiger and Javi Martínez, Kroos scored three goals in the team\\'s opening four Bundesliga matches. He also scored his first Champions League goal in Bayern\\'s opening group match against Valencia. After sustaining an injury in the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final against Juventus,[18] Kroos was unavailable for the remainder of the season, missing Bayern\\'s successes in the 2013 UEFA Champions League Final, the 2013 DFB-Pokal Final and the last seven matches of the Bundesliga season.[citation needed]\\nKroos returned to fitness for the start of the 2013–14 season and, played in the German Super Cup[19] and the UEFA Super Cup.[20] On 4 October 2013, scored his first goal of the season in a 1–1 draw against former club Bayer Leverkusen in the Bundesliga. He started two matches for Bayern in the 2013 FIFA Club World Cup.[21] The first against Guangzhou Evergrande in the 3–0 semi-final win on 17 December 2013,[22] and in the final as the team beat Raja Casablanca 2–0.[23][24]\\nOn 19 February 2014, Kroos scored his second goal of the season in a 2–0 Champions League win against Arsenal.[25] On 25 March, he scored in a 3–1 win over Hertha BSC as Bayern were confirmed as Bundesliga champions.[26]\\n\\nReal Madrid[edit]\\n2014–15: Debut season[edit]\\n Kroos playing for Real Madrid in 2015\\nPrior to joining Real Madrid, Kroos had a deal in place to join Manchester United after agreeing terms with David Moyes. However, after Moyes was sacked and Louis van Gaal replaced him, the Dutch manager decided against signing Kroos. Around the time of the 2014 World Cup he received a call from Carlo Ancelotti.[27]\\nOn 17 July 2014, Spanish La Liga club Real Madrid announced that they had reached an agreement for the transfer of Kroos, signing a six-year deal for an undisclosed fee.[28][29][30][31] The press reported that Kroos had cost between €24 and €30\\xa0million.[28][32][33][30][34][35] Greifswalder SV 04, the successor to his first youth team, received €60,000 from the transfer.[36]\\nKroos became the ninth German player, after Günter Netzer, Paul Breitner, Uli Stielike, Bernd Schuster, Bodo Illgner, Christoph Metzelder, Mesut Özil, and Sami Khedira, to join Real Madrid.[37] At his presentation in front of 8,000 supporters, he stated how Real Madrid is the \"biggest club in the world\" and is a \"cut above Bayern\".[38][39] He played in his debut match against Sevilla in the 2014 UEFA Super Cup on 12 August 2014, winning his first trophy at Real Madrid.[40][41]\\nHe was part of a midfield trio with James Rodríguez and Luka Modrić that led Real Madrid to 22-game winning run late in the year. On 8 November, Kroos scored his first goal for Real Madrid in a 5–1 win over Rayo Vallecano, at home.[42] In December, he helped the team win the 2014 FIFA Club World Cup, leading the tournament in assists. He was named to the FIFPro World XI and the UEFA Team of the Year.[citation needed]\\n\\n2015–19: Sustained domestic success and European dominance[edit]\\nIn 2015, Ancelotti was replaced by Rafa Benítez in Madrid\\'s command. Benítez was replaced in the middle of the season by Zinedine Zidane, under whom Kroos continued to be a key midfield player. Zidane said \"We signed Toni because we want him to mark an era\" and called Kroos \"perfect for Madrid\".[43] He was a regular starter when the team won the 2015–16 Champions League, his second Champions League trophy.[44] Los Blancos\\' triumph at San Siro meant that Kroos became the first-ever German to lift the Champions League trophy with two clubs.[45]\\nOn 12 October 2016, he signed a new contract until 2022, and by the end of the year he was once again nominated to the FIFPro World XI and the UEFA Team of the Year.[46] He scored the winning goal for Real Madrid in the 81-minute of the game against Celta Vigo as Real Madrid won their first home game of the La Liga season by 2–1.[47]\\nHe was a regular starter when Madrid won the 2016–17 La Liga and later defended their title in the 2016–17 Champions League. He became the first German player to win the trophy three times.[48][49][50] At the end of 2016–17, Kroos was the most used player under Zidane.[51]\\nDuring the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League, he made twelve appearances, when Madrid won their third consecutive and 13th overall Champions League title.[52]\\n\\n2019–present: Return of Zidane[edit]\\nOn 22 December 2018, Kroos won his record fifth FIFA Club World Cup after his team defeated Al Ain FC with a 4–1 margin in the final.[9] On 20 May 2019, he extended his contract with the club until 2023.[53][54]\\nKroos opened his goal account for the campaign in the La Liga season opener against Celta Vigo at Balaídos in a 3–1 win with a long range effort.[55]\\nOn 8 January 2020, Kroos scored his first Supercopa goal directly from a corner kick against Valencia in the 2019–20 Supercopa de España Semi-final in Jeddah as Los Blancos won 3–1.[56] Three days later, Real Madrid won the Supercopa after beating the local rivals Atlético Madrid on penalties.[57] On 16 February, Kroos again scored against Celta Vigo, this time at the Bernabeu in a 2–2 league draw.[58] This was his sixth goal against the Galician club, meaning he had scored against them more than any other team in his career.[citation needed]\\nOn 16 June, when La Liga restarted after a three-month hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Kroos scored Real Madrid\\'s first official goal at the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium in just four minutes in an eventual 3–1 win over Eibar.[59] One month later, Real Madrid went on a 10 game winning run and won the 2019–20 La Liga with Kroos featuring in all 11 matches post lockdown.[60] On 8 August, Kroos\\' season came to an end as City eliminated Madrid in the Champions League Round of 16 (4–2 on aggregate).[61] Despite a disappointing end to the season, this was Kroos\\' most prolific season in White netting six goals across all competitions.\\nOn 10 April 2021, Kroos scored his first El Clásico goal which came from a free-kick in the 28th minute at the Di Stefano Stadium which proved to be the winner in a vital 2–1 league win to send Los Blancos to the top of the league. This was Kroos\\' first free kick goal for Real Madrid in just his sixth attempt.[62]\\n\\nInternational career[edit]\\n Kroos with Germany in 2012\\nYouth teams[edit]\\nIn the 2007 FIFA U-17 World Cup, Toni Kroos was awarded the Golden Ball as the tournament\\'s best player and also won the Bronze Shoe after scoring five goals.[63] Kroos\\' debut for the national U-21 team came on 5 September 2008 in a 2009 Euro U-21 Championship Qualifier against Northern Ireland and scored the opening goal in the 11th minute,[64] his second goal for the U-21 side was goal in Germany\\'s 1–0 win over Italy, a precise long-range shot in the angle. It came as a surprise that coach Horst Hrubesch left him out of Germany\\'s U-21 squad for Euro 2009, and Germany went on to win the tournament without him.[65]\\n\\n2010 World Cup[edit]\\nIn January 2010, Kroos was called up to the senior Germany team for the first time, for a training session in Sindelfingen[66] and was named in the squad for the following match, a friendly against Argentina on 3 March 2010, in which he subsequently made his debut for the national side.[67]\\nKroos was selected to Joachim Löw\\'s 23-man squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. He made his FIFA World Cup debut in Germany\\'s final group-stage match versus Ghana, coming on in the 80th minute for Bastian Schweinsteiger, with Germany leading 1–0. He made further appearances as a substitute in the quarter-finals against Argentina, in the semi-finals against Spain and in the third place play-off against Uruguay.[citation needed]\\n\\nEuro 2012[edit]\\n Kroos (left) battles Julian Baumgartlinger for the ball in a UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying match against Austria in Vienna (Ernst-Happel-Stadion).\\nKroos established himself as a regular starter in Germany\\'s qualification campaign for UEFA Euro 2012, playing in eight out of a possible ten games. Germany won all ten qualifying matches to top group A. After qualification was already ensured, Kroos scored his first two international goals, both with his strong right foot. Notably, both Kroos\\' goals were Germany\\'s first after falling behind in the respective matches, both of which were drawn away friendlies, against the two Euro 2012 hosts – Poland and Ukraine. National coach Joachim Löw also praised him: \"How Toni distributes the ball, how he receives it, is very good. He\\'s technically excellent ... He has made progress in the last few matches, I\\'m extremely satisfied with the player.\"[68]\\nAt the tournament finals, Kroos appeared as a substitute in all three of Germany\\'s Group B matches. For the semi-final match against Italy, Löw selected the naturally attacking Kroos to man mark Italy\\'s playmaker Andrea Pirlo. The decision was heavily criticised as Germany lost the match 2–1.[69][70]\\n\\n2014 World Cup[edit]\\nDuring Germany\\'s 2014 World Cup qualifying campaign, Kroos scored his first two competitive international goals in a 6–1 win over the Republic of Ireland in Dublin. On 6 September 2013, he scored the team\\'s second goal in a 3–0 win over Austria.[citation needed]\\nKroos was named in Germany\\'s squad for the 2014 World Cup.[71] In the team\\'s opening match, a 4–0 defeat of Portugal, Kroos started in midfield and assisted Mats Hummels for Germany\\'s second goal.[72] Then in the quarter final the only goal scored by Mats Hummels against France came from his free kick.[73] In the semi-final against the host nation Brazil, Kroos scored two goals two minutes apart (24\\' and 26\\') in Germany\\'s 7–1 win.[74] He also recorded his fourth assist of the tournament, crossing for Thomas Müller\\'s opening goal, and was named man of the match by FIFA.[75] Kroos has been nicknamed Garçom (\"waiter\" in Portuguese) by the Brazilians for precisely delivering most passes to the strikers.[76]\\nOn 11 July, Kroos was named on the ten-man shortlist for FIFA\\'s Golden Ball award for the tournament\\'s best player.[77]\\nThe Castrol Performance Index, the official statistical analyser of the World Cup, rated Kroos as the best player at the 2014 World Cup, with a rating of 9.79 out of 10.[78]\\nKroos is considered the only player from the former German Democratic Republic to ever win the World Cup.[79]\\n\\n2018 World Cup[edit]\\nOn 4 June 2018, Kroos was included in Germany\\'s final 23-man squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.[80] On 23 June, Kroos scored from a free-kick in stoppage time against Sweden to resurrect Germany\\'s World Cup hopes with a 2–1 victory.[81] But in their next and last group stage match, his side were knocked out by South Korea after losing 2–0 four days later.[82]\\n\\n2020–21 UEFA Nations League[edit]\\nOn 13 October 2020, Kroos played his 100th match for Germany in a 3–3 draw against Switzerland in the 2020–21 UEFA Nations League A.[83]\\n\\nEuro 2020[edit]\\nOn 19 May 2021, he was selected to the squad for the UEFA Euro 2020.[84]\\nThree days after the team lost 0–2 against England in the Round of 16 on 29 June, Kroos announced his retirement from international football.[85][86]\\n\\nStyle of play[edit]\\n\\n\\n\"How Toni distributes the ball, how he receives it, is very good. He\\'s technically excellent ... He has made progress in the last few matches, I\\'m extremely satisfied with the player.\"\\n\\n\\n–Joachim Löw, Former manager of the Germany National Football Team[87]\\n\\n\\nA tall and athletic right-footed midfielder, Kroos is known for the range and accuracy of his distribution with either foot, his technique, vision, creativity, reading of the game, and his ability to dictate play in midfield or set up goals with his passing and ball delivery from set-pieces; he is also capable of scoring goals himself, courtesy of his striking ability – in particular from long range – and his accuracy from free kicks.[88][89][90][91][92] He has been described by Jonathan Wilson as \"perhaps the archetype of the modern attacking midfielder\". Wilson has also described Kroos as \"dynamic and hardworking\", and has praised him for his versatility, physical strength and ability to play in several midfield positions: in addition to his usual role, he has also been used in the centre as a deep-lying playmaker, on the flank, in a box-to-box role, or even as a defensive midfielder, due to his ability to both break up play, retain possession, and create chances for teammates.[4][93][94] Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes said in 2014 that Kroos, \"a top-class central midfielder\", was the player that United most needed to sign.[5]\\nFormer Netherlands captain Johan Cruyff said of Kroos\\' performances at the 2014 World Cup, \"He\\'s doing everything right: the pace in his passes is great and he sees everything. It\\'s nearly perfect.\"[95]\\n\\nPersonal life[edit]\\nKroos was born in Greifswald, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, on 4 January 1990.[31] He has a younger brother, Felix Kroos, who is also a professional footballer.[10] His father Roland works as youth coach for Hansa Rostock.[10] During his youth, he was a mediocre student and spent a lot of time practising football,[10] however, he was well-behaved in class and well liked among his peers at school.[10]\\nKroos married his long-term girlfriend Jessica Farber on 13 June 2015. They have two sons, Leon (born 14 August 2013),[96] Fin (born 26 March 2019)[97] and daughter, Amelie (born on 20 July 2016).[98] He owns a house on the island of Mallorca.[28]\\n\\nCareer statistics[edit]\\nClub[edit]\\nAs of match played 30 April 2022\\n\\nAppearances and goals by club, season and competition\\n\\n\\nClub\\n\\nSeason\\n\\nLeague\\n\\nNational cup[a]\\n\\nEurope\\n\\nOther\\n\\nTotal\\n\\n\\nLeague\\nApps\\nGoals\\nApps\\nGoals\\nApps\\nGoals\\nApps\\nGoals\\nApps\\nGoals\\n\\n\\nBayern Munich II\\n\\n2007–08[99]\\n\\nRegionalliga Süd\\n\\n12\\n3\\n—\\n—\\n—\\n12\\n3\\n\\n\\n2008–09[100]\\n\\n3.

Considered by many to be one of the greatest full-backs of all time,[3][4][5] Lahm was the captain of Bayern Munich, having led them to numerous honours including the 2013 UEFA Champions League as part of the Treble. He is also a former captain of his national team, which he led to win the 2014 FIFA World Cup, before retiring from international football.[2][6]\\nLahm was included in the World Cup team of the tournament in 2006, 2010, and 2014, and the UEFA Team of the Tournament in 2008 and 2012 and in the UEFA Team of the Year 2006, 2008, 2012, 2013 and 2014. \\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 Club career\\n\\n1.1 Early career\\n1.2 VfB Stuttgart (loan)\\n1.3 Bayern Munich\\n\\n\\n2 International career\\n\\n2.1 Youth teams and Euro 2004\\n2.2 2006 FIFA World Cup\\n2.3 Euro 2008\\n2.4 2010 FIFA World Cup\\n2.5 Euro 2012\\n2.6 2014 World Cup and retirement\\n2.7 Germany Euro 2024 bid\\n\\n\\n3 Style of play and reception\\n4 Personal life\\n5 Autobiography\\n6 Career statistics\\n\\n6.1 Club\\n6.2 International\\n\\n\\n7 Honours\\n8 See also\\n9 References\\n10 External links\\n\\n\\nClub career[edit]\\nEarly career[edit]\\nLahm developed into a professional football player within the Bayern Munich Junior Team.[2] He joined the team at the age of 11 after a youth coach, Jan Pienta, had scouted him several times while he was playing for the local youth team in his hometown Gern, Munich.[7] He was already considered very talented; one of his coaches, Hermann Hummels, even stated that \"If Philipp Lahm will not make it in the Bundesliga, nobody will anymore.\"[8] He twice won the Bundesliga youth title, the second time as  captain of his team,[7] and then was introduced into the B team at the age of 17. His former amateur coach Hermann Gerland considers Lahm to be the most talented player he has ever coached[9] and made him the captain of the B team during his second season. Up to this point Lahm played as a defensive midfielder, right midfielder or right full-back.[10]\\nOn 13 November 2002, Lahm made his debut for the Bayern Munich first team as a 92nd-minute substitute in a 3–3 draw with RC Lens in the group stage of the Champions League.[11] However, since Willy Sagnol and Bixente Lizarazu were established as Bayern\\'s first choice full-backs, and the club\\'s midfield was also well-staffed, Lahm made no further appearances during the 2002–03 season and was loaned to VfB Stuttgart for the 2003–04 and 2004–05 seasons to gain first team experience in the Bundesliga.[12]\\n\\nVfB Stuttgart (loan)[edit]\\nLahm was originally signed as a back-up for Andreas Hinkel, who played as right back, but coach Felix Magath moved him to the left back position, on which he toppled the German international Heiko Gerber.[13] He made his Bundesliga debut on the first day of the season 2003–04 against Hansa Rostock as he came in as a substitute left back in the 76th minute for midfielder Silvio Meissner. He made his first professional start as a left back on the fourth matchday as a 63rd-minute substitute for Gerber and his first game over the full 90 minutes followed on the sixth matchday against Borussia Dortmund. Thereafter he established himself as a regular left back for Stuttgart.[14] On 29 September 2003, Lahm made his first Champions League appearance as a starter against Manchester United. On 3 April 2004, he scored his first ever Bundesliga goal in a 5–1 away win for Stuttgart against VfL Wolfsburg. During the 2003–04 season Lahm appeared for Stuttgart in 31 Bundesliga and seven Champions League matches overall and came second in the election for the Germany Footballer of the year.\\nDuring his second season in Stuttgart, Lahm had substantially more difficult time.[13] After the Euro 2004 tournament and the resulting shorter vacation and pre-season training he had difficulties getting off the ground and also in conforming with the tactics and system of the new coach Matthias Sammer. However, he still made 16 Bundesliga appearances for Stuttgart before the Christmas break, 14 of them over the full 90 minutes, and six appearances in the UEFA Cup.[15] In January 2005, Lahm suffered a stress-fracture on his right foot and was thus sidelined for four months, making his comeback on 9 April 2005, against FC Schalke 04. Only around five weeks later, he was injured again, this time suffering a torn cruciate ligament which ended his season and simultaneously his career in Stuttgart.[7]\\n\\nBayern Munich[edit]\\nIn July 2005, Lahm returned to Bayern Munich.[2] However, the torn cruciate ligament he had suffered just before his return forced him to start his professional time in FC Bayern on rehabilitation. He returned to the field at the end of November playing first twice for the B team and thereafter making his first professional Bundesliga appearance for Bayern in November 2005 against Arminia Bielefeld.[16] During the 2005–06 season he appeared for Bayern 20 times in the Bundesliga and thrice in the Champions League, contending over field-time evenly with Bixente Lizarazu.\\n\\n Lahm in 2006\\nDuring the season 2006–07, Lahm played in all of Bayern\\'s 34 Bundesliga games and in nine of the ten Champions League games and was only substituted twice, mainly because Lahm was the only left back in the team but also due to his sufficiently solid performances during a season that was one of the worst for Bayern in many years. On 20 August 2006, in Bayern\\'s first away match of the season, a 2–1 win over VfL Bochum, he scored his first goal for the club.\\nFor the 2007–08 season, Bayern bought the German international left back Marcell Jansen and Lahm was supposed to revert to right, both to accommodate Jansen and to replace French right back Willy Sagnol. Due to injuries (both his and Jansen\\'s) he still mainly ended up playing left for Bayern and remained left for the end of the season, although he uttered his wish to play on right several times during the year 2008. During the whole season there were various rumors suggesting that Lahm would leave Bayern in the summer of 2008 to join FC Barcelona and the transfer seemed to be almost a done deal.[17] However, on  16 May 2008 FC Bayern signed a new contract with Lahm. His new contract kept him in Munich through 20 June 2012.[18]\\nLahm had his most prolific goalscoring season in 2008–09, scoring three times in the Bundesliga and once in the DFB-Pokal. However, the season was a poor one for Bayern, leading to the sacking of head coach Jürgen Klinsmann after less than a year in charge.\\nOn 8 November 2009, Lahm was given the highest fine in the history of Bayern Munich to date (estimated to be over €25,000) after giving an unauthorised interview in the Süddeutsche Zeitung. He criticised the transfer policy of the club and the lack of game philosophy and strategic planning.[19] Back in May 2008 Lahm had turned down lucrative offers from Manchester United and F.C. Barcelona to stay with Bayern as club president Uli Hoeneß promised to build a team that could challenge in Europe.[20][21][22] This incident drew mixed reactions from fans and the media, both local and foreign, with some saying that Lahm should have kept his opinions to himself and others praising him for his honesty.[23] Although he was fined and heavily criticised by the club hierarchy, he kept his place in the Bayern starting line-up and went on to have a good season.\\nDuring the 2009–10 season under the new coach Louis van Gaal, Lahm was able to play in his preferred position as a right back. After some difficulties in early games he played one of his best seasons ever, forming an excellent partnership on the right wing with Arjen Robben, scoring one goal and giving 12 assists in all of his games.[24] Lahm was also chosen as vice-captain by Van Gaal, and played full-time in all of Bayern\\'s competitive matches apart from the first-round game in the DFB-Pokal. Bayern went on to win the league and cup double and reached the 2010 UEFA Champions League Final, where Lahm played 90 minutes at right-back as they lost to Inter Milan 2–0.\\nAfter the departure of captain Mark van Bommel in January 2011, Lahm was made the new captain for the remainder of the 2010–11 season and eventually named club captain.[25]\\nOn 19 May 2012, Lahm captained Bayern in the 2012 UEFA Champions League Final against Chelsea at the Allianz Arena. He scored the team\\'s first penalty in the shootout but Bayern finished as runner-up for the second time in three seasons.[26]\\nIn the 2012–13 season, Lahm captained Bayern to an historic treble of the Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal and Champions League. In the final of the Champions League on 25 May 2013, Lahm helped his side to a 2–1 victory over fellow Bundesliga side Borussia Dortmund at historic Wembley Stadium in London.[27] After the game, he revealed how happy he was at winning the title, saying \"It\\'s incredible – a huge joy and huge relief. The pressure was enormous after losing in the Champions League final twice.\"[28]\\nFrom the start of the 2013–14 season, under new manager Pep Guardiola, Lahm has been utilised as a defensive midfielder.[29][30][31] Guardiola said of Lahm: \"[He] is perhaps the most intelligent player I have ever trained in my career. He is at another level.\"[30] That season brought a new milestone for Lahm and the club, as he captained Bayern to a record 24th Bundesliga title and the earliest league championship in Bundesliga history, retaining the title with seven games to spare, which beat the mark set by the club in the previous season.[32][33]\\nIn June 2014, Lahm signed a new contract keeping him at Bayern until 2018.[34] On 18 October, he scored the first brace of his career in a 6–0 defeat of SV Werder Bremen in the Bundesliga.[35] On 26 April 2015, Bayern were confirmed as Bundesliga champions for the third consecutive season, giving Lahm the seventh league championship of his career.[36]\\nOn 28 April 2015, Lahm was one of four Bayern players to miss in a 2–0 penalty shootout defeat to Borussia Dortmund in the DFB-Pokal semi-final.[37]\\nLeading up to the 2015–16 season, Bayern head coach Pep Guardiola stated that Lahm could return to his role at fullback with the arrivals Arturo Vidal and Joshua Kimmich.[38]\\n\\n Lahm holding the Meisterschale during the Championship title celebration in May 2016\\nOn 24 February 2016, Lahm made his 100th UEFA Champions League appearance in a 2–2 draw with Juventus in Turin.[39] He equaled Kahn\\'s record \"in Germany\" of 103 matches on 13 April 2016.[40] The 2015–16 season ended with Lahm captaining Bayern to a fourth consecutive Bundesliga title; the first time a team had won four back-to-back championships in the competition\\'s history.[41]\\nOn 4 February 2017, Lahm made his 500th appearance for FC Bayern in a 1–1 Bundesliga draw with Schalke 04.[42] Three days later, Lahm confirmed that he would be retiring at the end of the 2016–17 season.[43] He had rejected an offer from the club to become a sporting director.[44]\\nOn 20 May 2017, Lahm, along with teammate Xabi Alonso, made their final career appearance before retiring, Lahm captaining Bayern as they ended the season as champions for the fifth consecutive year.[19] He was substituted in the 87th minute and received a standing ovation from the Allianz Arena crowd in a 4–1 win over SC Freiburg.[45] It was confirmed on 19 July that Manuel Neuer will succeed Lahm as club captain.[46]\\nLahm entered Bayern Munich\\'s Hall of Fame on 27 May 2017; he won eight Bundesliga titles and the Champions League while playing for the club.[47]\\n\\nInternational career[edit]\\nYouth teams and Euro 2004[edit]\\n Lahm warming up for Germany in 2006\\nLahm started his international career in the U19 national team. He was part of the team that won silver for Germany in the 2002 UEFA European Under-19 Championship playing in all games in the final tournament and scoring a crucial goal in the 90th minute (2–3) against England in a game that ended 3–3.[48] Afterwards he played a few U20 and U21 matches for Germany before impressing Rudi Völler enough to hand the youngster his debut on 18 February 2004,[49] at 20 years of age. His first game was a 2–1 win over Croatia, where he played the full 90 minutes and was chosen as the man of the match by German football magazine Kicker.[50] He was also part of Germany\\'s team in UEFA Euro 2004 in Portugal and played full 90 minutes in all three games. Although Germany did not make it past the group stage, Lahm\\'s performance was considered very promising and many German papers saw this as the sole positive aspect in Germany\\'s lack of accomplishment in the tournament.\\n\\n2006 FIFA World Cup[edit]\\nLahm missed more than a year of international football between January 2005 and March 2006[51] due to injuries (stress-fracture on foot and a torn cruciate ligament), including the 2005 Confederations Cup, but after his recovery he immediately made it back to the starting line-up. Even though he injured his elbow in a friendly game right before the 2006 FIFA World Cup and thus had to wear a special cast on his left arm,[52] Jürgen Klinsmann still chose him as first option for the left back position. He scored the first goal in the opening game of the World Cup in Germany against Costa Rica in the sixth minute, cutting inside the area and launching a right foot shot into the top-right corner of the net. He was awarded Man of the Match for his performance in the second group game against Poland. He was also the only German player to play the complete 690 minutes of the World Cup and was also elected to the All Star Team of the tournament.\\n\\nEuro 2008[edit]\\nDuring UEFA Euro 2008 he was in Germany\\'s starting line-up in all games and was only substituted in the final after getting a cut needing stitches on his foot. Lahm started the tournament as a right back but replaced the under-performing Jansen as left back midway through the second game. On 25 June 2008, he scored the winning goal of the Euro 2008 semi-final against Turkey in the 90th minute. He described this as the most important goal of his career and although he was elected Man of the Match, he himself did not consider this as well-deserved.[53] On 29 June 2008 – in the Euro 2008 final against Spain – on 33 minutes Xavi played a piercing ball through the German defence and a lack of communication between Lahm and German goalkeeper Jens Lehmann allowed Fernando Torres to net the decisive goal in the game; Spain prevailed 1–0 to win its second European Championship title in 44 years.\\n\\n2010 FIFA World Cup[edit]\\n Lahm playing for Germany in 2011\\nLahm was ever present during Germany\\'s 2010 World Cup qualifying campaign and was the only player to play every single minute.\\nFollowing the withdrawal of regular captain Michael Ballack from the 2010 FIFA World Cup squad due to injury, Lahm was chosen to captain the team at the upcoming tournament.[54][55] On 13 June 2010, he captained the national team in the opening game of the 2010 FIFA World Cup against Australia, becoming the youngest player to captain a German side in a World Cup tournament. The team advanced all the way to the semi-finals, where they were defeated by Spain 1–0. Lahm did not play in the third-place (bronze) match against Uruguay due to an infection, so in his absence Bastian Schweinsteiger captained the team which won 3–2.[56]\\nLahm\\'s captaincy would later become permanent, when coach Joachim Löw announced that Ballack would not be considered to play for Germany anymore.[57][58]\\n\\nEuro 2012[edit]\\n Philipp Lahm playing against Nani at Euro 2012\\nCaptain Lahm\\'s solid defending helped Germany win all ten qualification matches for UEFA Euro 2012, and he also provided one assist each for Mesut Özil and Mario Gómez. He was an ever-present in the German defence that attracted praise from a variety of sources. Germany won all three group games against Portugal, Netherlands, and Denmark. Lahm scored the opening goal in their 4–2 victory over Greece in the quarter-finals. Germany was eliminated 2–1 by Italy in the semi-finals.\\n\\n2014 World Cup and retirement[edit]\\n Philipp Lahm lifting the 2014 FIFA World Cup trophy in Brazil\\nOn 6 September 2013, Lahm was awarded his 100th cap for the German national team in a 3–0 win over Austria during qualification for the 2014 World Cup.[59]\\nOn 16 June 2014, Lahm started for Germany in central midfield in their first match of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, a 4–0 defeat of Portugal in Salvador,[60] and remained in the position for the other two group games and the round of 16 match against Algeria.\\nLahm reverted to right back for the quarter-final against France, and remained there in Germany\\'s 7–1 defeat of Brazil in the semi-final. On 11 July 2014, Lahm was named on the 10-man shortlist for FIFA\\'s Golden Ball award for the tournament\\'s best player.[61]\\nOn 13 July 2014, Lahm led Germany to a World Cup victory, a 1–0 win against Argentina in the final, the fourth time Germany have won the competition and the first for a reunified Germany.[62] Fritz Walter, Franz Beckenbauer, and Lothar Matthäus had skippered West Germany to the World Cup title.[63]\\nOn 18 July 2014, Lahm, at the age of 30,[63] announced his retirement from international football.[49][63] He had scored five goals[49] in 113 appearances.[6][49][63] On 2 September 2014, Bastian Schweinsteiger succeeded Lahm as captain of the German national team.\\n\\nGermany Euro 2024 bid[edit]\\nOn 8 December 2017, Lahm was named honorary ambassador for Germany\\'s bid to host the UEFA Euro 2024.[64]\\n\\nStyle of play and reception[edit]\\nAlthough Lahm is right-footed, and normally played as a right-back, he was able to play on both sides of the pitch, either as a full-back/wing-back or wide midfielder, due to his tactical intelligence, crossing ability, and versatility.[19][65][66][67][68] He often cut from the flank to the inside of the pitch to either shoot and/or pass. In particular, he was renowned for his pace, technique, stamina, and precise tackling abilities, as well as his small stature, which earned him the nickname the \"Magic Dwarf\"; despite his size and playing role, he was described in 2010 by Matthew Scianitti of CBC Sports as having \"deceptive strength and impressive shooting skills,\" which allowed him to assist his teams both offensively and defensively.[69][70][71] During his time under manager Pep Guardiola, Lahm also occasionally played as a central or defensive midfielder, in a pivot role in a 3–4–3 formtion, which has been likened to that of a metodista (\"centre-half,\" in Italian football jargon), due to his ability to dictate play in midfield and act as a playmaker by starting attacks in addition to assisting his team defensively by winning back possession.[19][72][73][74] Owing to his positioning, tactical sense, and tackling ability despite his small stature, as well as his wide range of skills, such as ability to read the game, leadership qualities, consistency, and ability on the ball,[67][68][75][76] he is widely regarded by pundits as one of the best full-backs of all time.[3][4][5] Guardiola once described Lahm as \"perhaps the most intelligent player\" he had ever coached.[30]\\n\\nPersonal life[edit]\\nLahm is known as a private person who maintains a low-profile outside of football; his best friend Andreas Ottl was the only footballer present at his wedding to Claudia Schattenberg.[77][78] The couple have a son, Julian,[79] and a daughter, Lenia.[80] A Munich native, Lahm is a lifelong Bayern fan and served as a ball boy at the Olympic Stadium.[81]\\nLahm is involved in many charity campaigns and events. In June 2007, FIFA announced that Lahm and Owen Hargreaves would visit South Africa in advance to support the 2010 FIFA World Cup.[82] Although Hargreaves never managed to take part in the trip due to injury, Lahm and German national teammate Piotr Trochowski visited the country taking time not only to visit the 2010 FIFA World Cup organizers but also to visit a local SOS Children\\'s Village and to take part in the Kick-AIDS event.[83]\\nLahm has established a foundation, Philipp Lahm-Stiftung, to support underprivileged children and is also an official ambassador representing \"FIFA for SOS Children\\'s Villages\".[84] In addition he was an ambassador of the 2007, 2008 and 2009 World AIDS Day. He has also taken part in a campaign against speeding and various others such as Bündnis für Kinder, a campaign against child abuse.[17][85]\\nLahm was awarded a Tolerantia-Preis on 20 September 2008, due to his outstanding contribution against intolerance and homophobia in sports, particularly in football. He also stated that it\\'s a \"pity that being gay in football is still a taboo subject\" and he would have no problem with a homosexual teammate and is \"not afraid of homosexuals\".[86] However, Lahm does not advise footballers to publicly admit to being homosexual, because of the abuse they would suffer.[87][88]\\n\\nAutobiography[edit]\\nIn August 2011 at age 27 he released his autobiography, Der feine Unterschied: Wie man heute Spitzenfußballer wird (The Subtle Difference – How to Become a Top Footballer), reviewing his football career and personal experiences, the general football environment, football in the social context and the effectiveness of different coaching and training methods. The No.1 bestselling book received extensive media attention in Germany, and has been criticized for parts of the book in which he discerningly analyzed his former coaches\\' work, among the critics were Rudi Völler (himself criticized by Lahm in the book) and Ottmar Hitzfeld.[89]\\n\\nCareer statistics[edit]\\nClub[edit]\\nAs of 20 May 2017.\\n\\n\\nClub\\nSeason\\nLeague\\nCup1\\nContinental2\\nOther3\\nTotal\\nRef.\\n\\n\\nLeague\\nApps\\nGoals\\nApps\\nGoals\\nApps\\nGoals\\nApps\\nGoals\\nApps\\nGoals\\n\\n\\nBayern Munich II\\n2001–02\\nRegionalliga Süd\\n27\\n2\\n—\\n—\\n27\\n2\\n[90]\\n\\n\\n2002–03\\n34\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n35\\n1\\n[91]\\n\\n\\n2005–06\\n2\\n0\\n—\\n2\\n0\\n[92]\\n\\n\\nTotals\\n63\\n3\\n1\\n0\\n—\\n64\\n3\\n—\\n\\n\\nBayern Munich\\n2002–03\\nBundesliga\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n[93]\\n\\n\\n2005–06\\n20\\n0\\n4\\n0\\n3\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n27\\n0\\n[92]\\n\\n\\n2006–07\\n34\\n1\\n3\\n0\\n9\\n0\\n2\\n0\\n48\\n1\\n[94]\\n\\n\\n2007–08\\n22\\n0\\n5\\n0\\n10\\n1\\n3\\n0\\n40\\n1\\n[95]\\n\\n\\n2008–09\\n28\\n3\\n3\\n1\\n8\\n0\\n—\\n39\\n4\\n[96]\\n\\n\\n2009–10\\n34\\n0\\n6\\n1\\n13\\n0\\n53\\n1\\n[97]\\n\\n\\n2010–11\\n34\\n3\\n5\\n0\\n8\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n48\\n3\\n[98]\\n\\n\\n2011–12\\n31\\n0\\n5\\n0\\n14\\n0\\n—\\n50\\n0\\n[99]\\n\\n\\n2012–13\\n29\\n0\\n5\\n0\\n12\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n47\\n0\\n[100]\\n\\n\\n2013–14\\n28\\n1\\n4\\n0\\n12\\n0\\n4\\n0\\n48\\n1\\n[101][102]\\n\\n\\n2014–15\\n20\\n2\\n4\\n0\\n8\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n33\\n2\\n[103]\\n\\n\\n2015–16\\n26\\n1\\n6\\n0\\n12\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n45\\n1\\n[104][105]\\n\\n\\n2016–17\\n26\\n1\\n4\\n1\\n7\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n38\\n2\\n[106][107]\\n\\n\\nTotals\\n332\\n12\\n54\\n3\\n117\\n1\\n14\\n0\\n517\\n16\\n—\\n\\n\\nStuttgart (loan)\\n2003–04\\nBundesliga\\n31\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n7\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n40\\n1\\n[108]\\n\\n\\n2004–05\\n22\\n1\\n2\\n0\\n6\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n31\\n1\\n[109]\\n\\n\\nTotals\\n53\\n2\\n3\\n0\\n13\\n1\\n2\\n0\\n71\\n3\\n—\\n\\n\\nCareer totals\\n448\\n17\\n58\\n3\\n130\\n2\\n16\\n0\\n652\\n22\\n—\\n\\n1.^ Includes German Cup.\\n2.^ Includes UEFA Champions League and UEFA Cup.\\n3.^ Includes German League Cup, German Super Cup, UEFA Super Cup, and FIFA Club World Cup.\\nInternational[edit]\\n\\n\\nGermany\\n\\n\\nYear\\nApps\\nGoals\\n\\n\\n2004\\n15\\n1\\n\\n\\n2005\\n0\\n0\\n\\n\\n2006\\n15\\n1\\n\\n\\n2007\\n7\\n0\\n\\n\\n2008\\n15\\n1\\n\\n\\n2009\\n11\\n0\\n\\n\\n2010\\n12\\n1\\n\\n\\n2011\\n10\\n0\\n\\n\\n2012\\n10\\n1\\n\\n\\n2013\\n9\\n0\\n\\n\\n2014\\n9\\n0\\n\\n\\nTotal\\n113\\n5\\n\\nScores and results table.

He is widely regarded as one of the greatest defenders and players of all time.[6][7][8][9][10][11] As the Milan and Italy captain for many years he was nicknamed \"Il Capitano\" (\"The Captain\"). Maldini held the record for most appearances in Serie A, with 647, until 2020, when he was overtaken by Gianluigi Buffon.[12] He is currently serving as technical director for Milan, as well as being co-owner of USL Championship club Miami FC.\\nMaldini spent all 25 seasons of his playing career in the Serie A with Milan, before retiring at the age of 41 in 2009. He won 25 trophies with Milan: the European Cup/UEFA Champions League five times, seven Serie A titles, one Coppa Italia, five Supercoppa Italiana titles, four European/UEFA Super Cups, two Intercontinental Cups and one FIFA Club World Cup. Maldini won the Best Defender trophy at the UEFA Club Football Awards at the age of 39, as well as the Serie A Defender of the Year Award in 2004. Following his retirement after the 2008–09 season, Milan retired his number 3 shirt.[13]\\nMaldini made his debut for Italy in 1988, playing for 14 years before retiring in 2002 with 7 goals and 126 caps, an appearance record at the time, which has since been surpassed by Fabio Cannavaro and Gianluigi Buffon. Maldini captained Italy for eight years and held the record for appearances as Italy\\'s captain (75), until he was again overtaken by Cannavaro and Buffon.[14] With Italy, Maldini took part in four FIFA World Cups and three UEFA European Championships. Although he did not win a tournament with Italy, he reached the final of the 1994 World Cup and Euro 2000, and the semi-final of the 1990 World Cup and Euro 1988. He was elected into the all-star teams for each of these tournaments, in addition to Euro 1996.\\nMaldini came second to George Weah for FIFA World Player of the Year in 1995. He also placed third in the Ballon d\\'Or in 1994 and 2003.[15] In 2002, he was chosen as a defender on the FIFA World Cup Dream Team, and in 2004 Pelé named him in the FIFA 100 list of the world\\'s greatest living players.[16] He was also selected for the Ballon d\\'Or Dream Team in 2020. Maldini held the record for most appearances in UEFA Club competitions, with 174, until he was overtaken by Iker Casillas in 2017.[17] He is the record appearance holder for Milan with 902 appearances in all competitions,[13] and is one of only thirty-two players to have made over 1,000 career appearances.[18][19][20] In December 2012, he was inducted into the Italian Football Hall of Fame.[21] Maldini\\'s father Cesare also played for and captained Milan, and was a successful national under-21 manager, who also coached Milan and the senior national side during the 1998 World Cup.\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 Club career\\n\\n1.1 1984–1987: Youth career, AC Milan senior debut and early professional career\\n1.2 1987–1991: Domestic and international success with The immortals\\n1.3 1991–1996: Continued success with The invincibles\\n1.4 1996–2001: Assuming the captaincy, struggles, and 1999 Serie A title\\n1.5 2001–2007: New era of success\\n1.6 2008–2009: Final years and retirement\\n\\n\\n2 International career\\n\\n2.1 Early career and 1990 World Cup\\n2.2 1994 World Cup Final and appointment to captaincy\\n2.3 Euro 2000 Final and fourth World Cup\\n\\n\\n3 After retirement\\n4 Player profile\\n\\n4.1 Style of play\\n4.2 Legacy\\n\\n\\n5 Media\\n6 Personal life\\n7 Career statistics\\n\\n7.1 Club\\n7.2 International\\n\\n\\n8 Honours\\n9 Notes\\n10 See also\\n11 References\\n12 External links\\n\\n\\nClub career[edit]\\n1984–1987: Youth career, AC Milan senior debut and early professional career[edit]\\nOriginally a AC Milan youth squad product, Maldini also went on to play his entire club career with the senior side. He won the Coppa Italia Primavera with the Milan Youth side during the 1984–85 season, and he made his league debut for Milan under manager Nils Liedholm during the same season on 20 January 1985, replacing the injured Sergio Battistini in a match against Udinese at age 16.[22] It was his only league appearance of the campaign, but he was immediately made a member of the starting eleven the following season, at age 17, at right-back, being handed the number 3 shirt, which had previously also belonged to his father, Cesare.[23] He was later switched to his more iconic position of left-back due to his ability with his left foot. Maldini also made his Coppa Italia debut in 1985, on 21 August, while his debut in European competition also came later that same year, on 18 September.[24] He scored the first of his 29 goals in Serie A on 4 January 1987[25] in a 1–0 win against Como.[26][27]\\n\\n1987–1991: Domestic and international success with The immortals[edit]\\nThe 1987–88 Scudetto under Arrigo Sacchi marked Maldini\\'s first trophy, and the first of seven league titles, with the club.[28] Nicknamed \"The Immortals\", Sacchi\\'s Milan side is remembered for including the Dutch trio of Frank Rijkaard, Ruud Gullit and Marco van Basten, as well as the Italian midfielders Carlo Ancelotti, Roberto Donadoni (and later Demetrio Albertini), and a strong defensive lineup.[29] Under Sacchi and later Fabio Capello, Maldini formed with long-timers Franco Baresi, Alessandro Costacurta, Mauro Tassotti, as well as Filippo Galli, Stefano Nava and later Christian Panucci, one of football\\'s strongest defensive quartets of all time.[a] During the 1987–88 Serie A season, Milan only conceded 14 goals, finishing with the best defence in Italy, as they went on to win the Serie A title. Following Baresi\\'s retirement, he also formed a formidable and successful partnership with Alessandro Nesta. Maldini went on to win the 1988 Supercoppa Italiana with Milan the following season, and followed up this trophy with back to back European Cup titles in 1988–89 and 1989–90, while Milan finished in third and in second place in Serie A during those respective seasons.[26][27] On 19 February 1989, Maldini made his 100th appearance in Serie A.[24]\\nMilan reached the final of the 1989–90 Coppa Italia, losing out to Juventus. Milan also managed to capture successive European Super Cup titles in 1989 and 1990, as well as successive Intercontinental Cup titles, once again 1989 and 1990. The following season, in Sacchi\\'s final season with the club, Milan were eliminated in the quarter-finals of the European Cup by eventual finalists Marseille, and finished second in Serie A, behind Sampdoria, once again with the best defence in the league, conceding only 19 goals. Milan reached the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia, losing out to eventual champions Roma. In 1989, Maldini was awarded the Bravo Award, as the best under-23 player in European Competitions.[26][27]\\n\\n1991–1996: Continued success with The invincibles[edit]\\nUnder Sacchi\\'s replacement, Fabio Capello, Milan continued to be a dominant force in Italy and in Europe. Maldini was also part of Milan\\'s undefeated Serie A team, which won the championship in the 1991–92 season; in total, Milan went unbeaten for an Italian record of 58 league matches, earning the nickname \"The Invincibles\".[38] This championship was Milan\\'s first of three consecutive Serie A titles under Capello in the early 1990s. Maldini helped Milan defend the Serie A title the following season, and reach the first of three consecutive UEFA Champions League finals. Milan lost the 1993 Champions League final in a 1–0 defeat to Marseille. That season, Maldini scored his first goal in European Competitions on 21 October 1992 in a 1–0 Champions League win against Slovan Bratislava,[26] and also made his 200th appearance in Serie A on 4 October of the same year.[24] The following season, Milan captured their third consecutive Serie A title, finishing with the best defence in Italy, conceding just 15 goals. Maldini also helped lead Milan to a second consecutive Champions League final, where he helped his team defeat Barcelona. Due to Alessandro Costacurta\\'s suspension and injuries sustained to Franco Baresi, Jean-Pierre Papin and Marco van Basten, Barcelona\\'s \"Dream Team\", coached by Johan Cruyff, were heavy favourites to win the trophy, with the formidable attacking duo of Romário and Hristo Stoichkov.[39] Despite their key absences, Maldini helped the Milan defence keep a clean sheet and overcome Barcelona 4–0 in the final, with two goals from Daniele Massaro and one each from Dejan Savićević and Marcel Desailly.[26][27][39]\\nAfter winning his third Champions League title and reaching the 1994 World Cup final, Maldini became the first defender ever to win World Soccer magazine\\'s annual World Player of the Year Award. During his acceptance speech, Maldini called his milestone \"a particular matter of pride because defenders generally receive so much less attention from fans and the media than goalscorers. We are more in the engine room rather than taking the glory\".[40] He then singled out Milan captain Franco Baresi as a player who \"really [deserved] to receive the sort of award I have received\".[40] Maldini also placed third in the 1994 Ballon d\\'Or, behind Stoichkov and compatriot Roberto Baggio, and fifth in the FIFA World Player of the Year Award.[26][27]\\nThe following season, Milan and Maldini captured their third consecutive Supercoppa Italiana under Capello, and won the European Super Cup, missing out on the Intercontinental Cup. After three consecutive titles, Milan were unable to retain their Serie A title, although they reached their third consecutive Champions League final, where they were defeated 1–0 by Ajax. Maldini came second behind future teammate George Weah in the 1995 FIFA World Player of the Year Award for his performances. On 17 February 1995, he made his 300th appearance in Serie A.[24] Maldini was able to capture his fifth Serie A title, and his fourth under Capello, the following season.[26][27]\\n\\n1996–2001: Assuming the captaincy, struggles, and 1999 Serie A title[edit]\\nFollowing Capello\\'s departure, and the aging and retirement of several key players, Milan suffered disappointing results during the next few seasons, undergoing several managerial changes. Milan lost the Supercoppa Italiana to Fiorentina in 1996, and failed to qualify for European competitions for two consecutive seasons, as well as suffering a group stage elimination in the 1996–97 Champions League. Following Franco Baresi\\'s and Mauro Tassotti\\'s retirement after the 1996–97 season, Maldini was appointed Milan\\'s captain. Despite the difficulties Milan encountered during this period, through Maldini\\'s leadership, they reached the Coppa Italia final in 1998, losing to Lazio, and won the 1998–99 Serie A title under Alberto Zaccheroni, finishing one point ahead of Lazio. He made his 400th Serie A appearance on 25 April 1999.[24] In the 1999–2000 season, Milan lost the Supercoppa Italiana against Parma, finished third in Serie A and finished bottom of their Champions League group. Milan were eliminated in the second round of the Champions League the next season and finished in sixth place in Serie A, failing to qualify for the Champions League, and participated in the UEFA Cup the following season.[26][27]\\n\\n2001–2007: New era of success[edit]\\n Maldini lifting the European Cup for Milan after winning the 2003 UEFA Champions League Final\\nMilan again became a dominant force in Italy and in Europe under Carlo Ancelotti. In the 2001–02 season, Milan finished in fourth place, qualifying for the Champions League, and also reached their best ever finish in the UEFA Cup, losing in the semi-finals. In 2002, Maldini was awarded the Premio Nazionale Carriera Esemplare \"Gaetano Scirea\", for his career achievements and personality.[41] The following season, Maldini lined up with Alessandro Nesta, Alessandro Costacurta and Cafu, who, along with Jaap Stam during the 2004–05 season, formed a formidable defensive lineup in Italy and in Europe. Milan finished third in Serie A, but Maldini won the first Coppa Italia of his career, defeating Roma in the final.[26][27] On 15 March 2003, he made his 500th appearance in Serie A.[24]\\nMilan won the 2002–03 Champions League with Maldini as their captain for the first time in his career, in the first all-Italian final, against Juventus, on 28 May 2003 at Old Trafford. Maldini helped Milan keep a clean sheet, as they defeated Juventus 3–2 on penalties after a 0–0 deadlock following extra time. On that day, it was exactly 40 years since his father, Cesare, had also lifted the European Cup trophy as Milan\\'s captain, also in England.[42] He and his father are only one of three other father-son pairs to have also done so; the others being Manuel and Manolo Sanchís of Real Madrid, and Carles and Sergio Busquets of Barcelona. Maldini was elected Man of the Match and was named in the UEFA Team of the Year for the first time in his career.[26][27]\\nThe following season, Milan were defeated by Juventus on penalties in the Supercoppa Italiana, and in the Intercontinental Cup final by Boca Juniors, once again on penalties, but managed to defeat Porto to capture yet another UEFA Super Cup. Maldini placed third in the 2003 Ballon d\\'Or for the second time in his career. Maldini went on to captain Milan to win the Serie A title that season, with a record 82 points, whilst Milan were eliminated in the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia by Lazio, and in the quarter-finals of the Champions League by Deportivo de La Coruña. In April 2004, Maldini placed tenth on the UEFA Golden Jubilee Poll, an online UEFA survey, which was organised to commemorate the best European footballers of the past 50 years. Maldini was the second-highest placed Italian after Dino Zoff.[43] Maldini was also included in the FIFA 100 list in 2004, which was a selection of the 125 greatest living footballers, chosen by Pelé. Following his Series A-winning performances, Maldini was elected to be the Serie A Defender of the Year in 2004 at the Italian footballing Awards.[26][27]\\n\\n Maldini celebrating the 2007 UEFA Champions League triumph with his Milan teammates. At 38, he was the oldest captain to lift the trophy.\\nMaldini began the next season by lifting the 2004 Supercoppa Italiana as captain after Milan defeated Lazio. Milan finished second in Serie A to Juventus that season, and reached the Champions League final, only to lose out on penalties to Liverpool, although Maldini opened the scoring in the first minute. In 2005, Maldini was elected to be a part of the UEFA Team of the Year for the second time in his career, and was also elected to be the part of the FIFPro World XI for the first time in his career. The following season, Milan finished second behind Juventus in Serie A once again, and reached the Champions League semi-finals, only to be defeated by eventual champions Barcelona. Both Juventus and Milan were later deducted points for being involved in the 2006 \"Calciopoli\" matchfixing scandal, and the title was awarded to Internazionale, while Juventus were relegated, with Milan finishing in third place after the point deduction. During the season, Maldini scored his first and only double of his career, against Reggina. On 25 September 2005, Maldini broke Dino Zoff\\'s Serie A appearance record after playing his 571st league match against Treviso;[44] seven days earlier, he had played his 800th game in all competitions for Milan.[26][27]\\nThe following season, Maldini helped to captain Milan to a fourth-place finish, despite their point deduction, leading them to obtain a crucial Champions League qualifying spot. Maldini played his 600th Serie A match on 13 May 2007 in a 1–1 draw at Catania.[45] That season, Maldini captained Milan to their third Champions League final in six years, leading them to a 2–1 victory over Liverpool in the final on 23 May 2007 in Athens, avenging their defeat from 2005. At age 38, Maldini became the oldest captain to lift the Champions League trophy.[46] Maldini participated in eight Champions League finals during his career, which is equalled only by Francisco Gento of Real Madrid; Maldini lifted the trophy five times, twice as captain. In an interview with ESPN aired prior to the 2007 final, Maldini labeled the 2005 Champions League final as the worst moment of his career. A match where he scored the fastest-ever goal in a European Cup final after 51 seconds and became the oldest player ever to score in a final, Milan lost on penalties to Liverpool after leading 3–0 at half-time. Maldini was elected the UEFA Club Defender of the Year for his 2007 performances.[26][27]\\nIn 2007, after Milan won the UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla (although Maldini did not appear in the match), Maldini became the first European captain to lift the FIFA Club World Cup after defeating Boca Juniors on 16 December. He announced his plans to retire at the end of the 2007–08 season, saying that he would do so with \"no regrets\".[47] Following Milan\\'s elimination from the Champions League by Arsenal in March, however, Maldini stated that he would possibly delay his retirement for at least a further year.[48] He signed an extension on 6 June that kept him at Milan for the 2008–09 season.[49]\\n\\n2008–2009: Final years and retirement[edit]\\n Maldini in 2008\\nOn 16 February 2008, in the match against Parma at the Stadio Ennio Tardini, Maldini came on for defender Marek Jankulovski to make his 1,000th professional career appearance,[50][51] of which 861 were with Milan, 12 with the Italy under-21 side, 1 with the Italian Olympic team and 126 with the Italy senior team.[52] In European football, only the English goalkeeper Peter Shilton had collected more appearances at the time: 1,390 between 1966 and 1997. Maldini played his last game in the Champions League on 4 March 2008, a 2–0 loss at the San Siro in the last 16 against Arsenal which eliminated Milan from the 2007–08 Champions League. In 2008, Maldini was awarded the FIFA Order of Merit, as well as the Premio Internazionale Giacinto Facchetti, which is awarded to a player who was demonstrated both skill and fair play throughout his career.[27][53]\\nOn 18 April 2009, Maldini announced that he would retire at the end of the 2008–09 season.[26][27] On 17 May 2009, in the Stadio Friuli, Maldini played his 900th official match for Milan in a league game against Udinese. Maldini\\'s last match in San Siro was on 24 May, a 3–2 loss against Roma, and was given a standing ovation by the fans. There was a small controversy, however, when the Milan Ultras fans known as Brigate Rossonere protested against Maldini as he said goodbye.[54][55] His last appearance for Milan, and his last game as an active player, was a 2–0 win against Fiorentina on 31 May 2009 in the last match of the Serie A season. This win meant Milan finished in third place and qualified for the following season\\'s Champions League. Maldini was once again given a standing ovation by the fans. As they had previously done with Franco Baresi\\'s number 6 shirt, Milan retired Maldini\\'s number 3 shirt, but stated that it will be bequeathed to one of his sons if one of them were to make the club\\'s senior team.[27][56][57]\\nOn 28 August 2009 in Monte Carlo, Paolo Maldini was Awarded a prize for his career by UEFA during the draw for the group stage of the 2009–10 Champions League.[58] On 17 November 2009, Spanish sports newspaper Marca awarded Maldini the \"Marca Leyenda\" prize for his career and achievements.[59][60]\\n\\nInternational career[edit]\\nEarly career and 1990 World Cup[edit]\\n Maldini\\'s Italy jersey from the 1990 FIFA World Cup, located in the Football Museum in Florence\\nIn 1986, Maldini was called up by his father Cesare Maldini to the Italian under-21 national team, and made his debut for the team on the 12 November of that year, in a 0–0 draw against Austria;[61][24] he earned 12 caps and scored five goals in two years with the azzurrini,[61] with his first goal coming on 11 February 1987, in a 2–1 win against Portugal.[61][24] Maldini was also member of the under-21 team that finished runners-up to Spain in the 1986 UEFA European Under-21 Championship.[62][63] Two years later, he also featured for the under-21 team that was eliminated in the first round against eventual winners France in the 1988 UEFA European Under-21 Championship.[64]\\nMaldini made his senior debut for the Italy senior team at age 19 on 31 March 1988 in a 1–1 friendly draw against Yugoslavia in Split,[65] and made one appearance for the Italy Olympic squad on 28 October 1987,[24] although he was not part of the team that finished in fourth place at the 1988 Olympics. Maldini featured in all four of Italy\\'s games at UEFA Euro 1988, where they reached the semi-finals, losing to the Soviet Union.[27][61][66]\\nMaldini participated in his first World Cup in 1990 on home soil, appearing in all seven Italy matches. He helped Italy to win five consecutive games and was a starting member of the defence that kept a FIFA World Cup record of five consecutive clean sheets. The Italian defence eventually conceded an equalising goal in the semi-final match against Carlos Bilardo\\'s Argentina, after going a World Cup record total of 518 minutes without conceding.[67] Following two periods of extra time, in which neither team was able to score, Italy lost out to Argentina on penalties. Italy eventually placed third after defeating England 2–1 in the third-place final match, and finishing the tournament with the best defence having conceded two goals throughout the entire World Cup. Maldini was elected to be part of the Team of the Tournament.[27][61]\\n\\n1994 World Cup Final and appointment to captaincy[edit]\\n Maldini with Italy in 1994\\nMaldini\\'s first international goal came in his 44th career match, in a 2–0 friendly win over Mexico in Florence on 20 January 1993.[65] Maldini was part of the Italy squad that participated in the 1992 U.S. Cup, finishing in second place in the friendly tournament, behind the host nation. Italy failed to qualify for Euro 1992, finishing second in their group, but qualified for the 1994 World Cup, where Maldini was named vice-captain for Italy. During the 1994 World Cup, Maldini played in all seven of Italy\\'s matches, and deputised for the injured Franco Baresi in the matches against Mexico, Nigeria, Spain and Bulgaria, keeping a clean sheet in the group match against Norway. Maldini led the Italian defence to the final, playing both as a centre-back and as a full-back, due to the absences of his Milan and Italy defensive teammates Baresi, due to injury, Mauro Tassotti, due to suspension after the quarter-finals, and Alessandro Costacurta, who was suspended for the final. Maldini helped Italy keep a clean sheet in the final against favourites Brazil as the team eventually lost on penalties. As in 1990, Maldini was named in the Team of the Tournament, 32 years after his father Cesare received the same honour at the 1962 World Cup.[27][61]\\n\\n\\n\\nItaly’s goalkeeper: easiest job in Europe.\\n\\n\\n—Nike slogan accompanied with an image of Maldini which appeared on billboards prior to Euro 96.[68]\\n\\n\\nAfter Franco Baresi\\'s international retirement in 1994, Maldini was appointed the team\\'s full-time captain. A disappointing Euro 1996 campaign saw Italy eliminated in the group stage with four points, in a group which contained the two eventual finalists of the tournament, Germany and the Czech Republic. Maldini played in all three of Italy\\'s group matches. The 1998 World Cup in France saw Italy start strongly, topping their group. Maldini played in all five of Italy\\'s matches, and started the play that led to Christian Vieri\\'s opening goal in Italy\\'s first match against Chile, which ended in a 2–2 draw. Maldini, partnering with Alessandro Costacurta, Fabio Cannavaro, Alessandro Nesta and Giuseppe Bergomi, also helped Italy to keep clean sheets in the second group match against Cameroon, the round of 16 match Norway and France in the quarter-finals, but Italy eventually went out of the tournament to the hosts and eventual champions on penalties, for the third consecutive time in a World Cup.[27]\\n\\nEuro 2000 Final and fourth World Cup[edit]\\nMaldini made his 100th appearance for Italy on 28 April 1999, in a 0–0 friendly away draw against Croatia, under manager Dino Zoff.[69] The following year, Italy reached the final of Euro 2000, but lost once again to defending World Cup champions France in extra time. Maldini played in all six of Italy\\'s matches during the tournament. Italy topped their group, winning every match, and Maldini, starting alongside Fabio Cannavaro and Alessandro Nesta, helped the Italian defence to concede only two goals en route to the final, keeping clean sheets against co-hosts Belgium in the group stage, Romania in the quarter-finals and co-hosts the Netherlands in the semi-finals. A ten-man Italy advanced to the final on penalties after a 0–0 draw with the Dutch following extra time. Although Maldini missed his penalty, Italy won the shootout 3–1.[70] Italy were leading 1–0 in the final until Wiltord equalised in the final minute of stoppage time. David Trezeguet scored the golden goal in the 103rd minute, in extra time.[71] In all of the three UEFA European Championships in which Maldini participated, he was elected to be part of the team of the tournament for his performances.[27]\\nOn 7 October 2000, in a 3–0 win over Romania in Milan in a 2002 World Cup qualifier, Maldini overtook Dino Zoff to become Italy\\'s most capped player of all time with his 113th senior international appearance for Italy.[72] Maldini played in his fourth World Cup, and his second as captain, in the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan. He helped Italy keep a clean sheet in their opening win against Ecuador, and played in all four of Italy\\'s matches. Italy disappointed in the remaining group matches, but went on to the knockout round as the second placed team of their group. Immediately after a ten-man Italy were controversially eliminated in the round of sixteen, by a golden goal, to co-hosts South Korea, Maldini retired from international football, at the age of 34, as Italy\\'s most capped player.[27] He scored seven international goals, all coming in home games. He spent over half of his 16 years as an international as team captain, wearing the armband a record 74 times,[73] until he was overtaken by Cannavaro, and subsequently Buffon.[61][74] Despite his performances for his country, Maldini was unable to win a trophy, although he reached the final of both the World Cup and the European Championship. Maldini made 23 appearances in World Cups, the second highest total after Lothar Matthäus, who appeared in 25 matches. Maldini holds the record for most minutes played in World Cup matches with 2,216 minutes played.[75]\\nIn February 2009, Italian head coach Marcello Lippi declared his support for a testimonial match for Maldini, stating that it would give him a chance to play for the Azzurri for a final time.[76] The Italian Football Federation (FIGC) offered him a place in the line-up in a friendly match against Northern Ireland. Maldini, however, rejected the offer, saying that he wanted to part with football in an \"official\" match.[77]\\n\\nAfter retirement[edit]\\n Maldini in a 2014 charity match\\nPrior to his retirement, Maldini expressed that he would never be moving into a coaching career.[78][79] He was offered a position that would have reunited him with his former manager Carlo Ancelotti by joining Chelsea as a coach, having reportedly met with Ancelotti and with Chelsea\\'s owner, Roman Abramovich, to discuss such a possibility.[80] Ancelotti later announced that Maldini had turned down his offer to become part of Chelsea\\'s coaching staff.[81]\\nIn 2012, Maldini was inducted into the Italian Football Hall of Fame. Maldini played in the 11th Match Against Poverty on 4 March 2014, appearing with other star players including Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane, Luís Figo and Pavel Nedvěd, which was held in Bern, Switzerland, with proceeds raised helping the recovery efforts in the Philippines in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan.[82][83] On 1 September 2014, Maldini, along with many current and former footballing stars, took part in the \"Match for Peace\", which was played at the Stadio Olimpico, Rome, with the proceeds being donated to charity.[84][85][86] In May 2015, it was announced that Maldini became the co-owner of North American Soccer League (NASL) club Miami FC, alongside television rights entrepreneur Riccardo Silva, in hope that the team would be able to join the Major League Soccer (MLS) in future.[87] On 1 May 2016, Maldini became the second player ever after Southampton\\'s Matthew Le Tissier to receive the One Club Man Award from Basque club Athletic Bilbao; he was presented with the prize at half-time, during the club\\'s 2–1 home win over Celta de Vigo, and received a standing ovation from the attending fans.[88]\\nIn June 2017, Maldini qualified for the Aspria Tennis Cup in Milan, a professional tennis tournament on the ATP Challenger Tour, along with his doubles partner Stefano Landonio, after winning a qualifier in Italy.[89] They were defeated in the first round by Tomasz Bednarek and David Pel by a score of 6–1, 6–1.[90] After the defeat, Maldini conceded that it was likely to be his last professional tennis match.[91]\\nIn August 2018, a few weeks after Milan\\'s change of ownership in favour of Elliott Management Corporation, he accepted an offer to become the sporting strategy & development director for the club, working alongside new sporting director Leonardo. This marked his comeback to the club since his retirement from active football.[92] On 14 June 2019, Maldini was promoted to technical director.[93]\\n\\nPlayer profile[edit]\\nStyle of play[edit]\\n\\n\\n\"Maldini was the best and toughest defender I ever faced. He had everything: he was a complete defender, who was strong, intelligent, and an excellent man-marker.\"\\n\\n\\n—Zlatan Ibrahimović.[94]\\n\\n\\nAlthough he played as a left back for most of his career, Maldini was naturally right footed, and began playing for Milan as a right back. He was switched to the left back position by manager Arrigo Sacchi due to the presence of Mauro Tassotti on the right for Milan.[95] This was made possible due to Maldini\\'s tactical versatility and ability with both feet, which allowed him to play anywhere along the backline, and have a long and successful professional career, both with Milan and Italy.[96][97]\\n\\n\\n\\n\"He was one of the best defenders in Champions League history, but what was so impressive about him is that when he was on the ball he didn\\'t look like a defender, but like an elegant midfield player.\"\\n\\n\\n—Ronaldinho.[98][99]\\n\\n\\nMaldini was renowned for his technical ability, athleticism, sliding tackles, stamina, composure and fast energetic forward runs as a left-back or wing-back.[100][101][102][103][104] He was also an excellent crosser of the ball, and was an effective attacking threat, scoring and assisting several goals throughout his career.[105][106] In the final few years of his career, as he lost speed, he was moved to a centre-back position, where he excelled in relying on his experience, tactical ability, positioning and timing to win the ball.[107]\\nAs a centre-back, Maldini was renowned for his marking, awareness and ability to anticipate a threat from the opposition.[11][108] Despite being a precise tackler and an imposing defensive presence, he often avoided committing to challenges when he deemed them unnecessary,[109] preferring to restrict the offensive play of his opponents through his positioning and marking.[110] Maldini was also known for his aerial ability, strength, tackling and man-marking, as well as his tactical knowledge.[96][100][111] His passing range and ability to begin plays from the backline also allowed him to advance into the midfield and excel in the sweeper or libero position, on the rare occasion that he was deployed in this role.[100][112]\\n\\nLegacy[edit]\\n\\n\\n\"I always found it very difficult when I came up against Paolo Maldini. He was the best defender I faced over the course of my career. He definitely deserved to win the award FIFA World Player of the Year several times over.\"\\n\\n\\n—Ronaldo.[113]\\n\\n\\nMaldini is considered to have been one of the greatest defenders of all time, and has been described as \"an icon and gentleman of the game\".[11][114] He was known for his calm and composed manner on the pitch, as well as his ability to read the game, preferring elegance and intelligence to physicality and aggression when defending; regarded as a correct player, known for his discipline on the pitch, he only received three red cards throughout his entire career.[11][115][116] In a 2002 FIFA poll, Maldini was selected as a defender in the FIFA World Cup Dream Team.[117]\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Paolo Maldini. When you found him in front of you you knew you would not pass. He was big. He was strong with his head, with his right foot, with his left foot... You needed to put together 15 players to make one like him.\"\\n\\n\\n—Roberto Baggio in 2017, when he was asked who was the best defender he had ever faced.[118]\\n\\n\\n Maldini\\'s Milan jersey next to Dejan Savićević\\'s number 10 in the San Siro museum\\nMaldini was the first defender ever shortlisted for the FIFA World Player of the Year award, finishing second in 1995.[119] He was also twice elected as a finalist for the Ballon d\\'Or, in 1994 and in 2003, where he finished third on both occasions. In addition to his team success, he also won several individual accolades and awards. He won the UEFA Defender of the year, the Serie A defender of the year, the Bravo Award and the World Soccer Player of the Year Award. He has also been elected as part of the UEFA Team of the Year, the FIFPro World XI, the World Cup Team of the Tournament and the European Championship Team of the Tournament during his career. Maldini was a symbol of his club and the Italian national football team.[120][121] He was renowned for his consistency, versatility, work-rate, and longevity, breaking into the Milan starting lineup as a teenager and remaining there throughout his career until he retired at the age of 41.[122]\\nThroughout his career, Maldini was also considered to be a leader, both for Milan and for the Italian national team, earning the nickname \"Il Capitano\" (\"The Captain\").[123] He was renowned for his vocal, commanding presence on the pitch, and for his awareness, communication and organisational skills, helping to motivate his teammates and ensuring they remained in position.[108] He played in over 1,000 professional matches during his 25 seasons at Milan, and was the record appearance holder in Serie A until he was overtaken by Gianluigi Buffon in 2020, and still is for Milan in all competitions. Maldini also appeared in a record eight UEFA Champions League Finals, and is the record appearance holder in all UEFA club competitions.[108] With 126 caps during the 16 years he played for Italy, he was the record appearance holder for the national team, until he was overtaken by Fabio Cannavaro in 2009 and by Gianluigi Buffon in 2013. He also formerly held the record number of caps for Italy as captain, wearing the armband on 74 occasions,[11] until being overtaken by Cannavaro.[124] Maldini has inspired many defenders like Rio Ferdinand, Rafael Márquez and Carles Puyol.[125][126][127]\\n\\nMedia[edit]\\nMaldini has appeared in commercials for the American sportswear company Nike.[128][129] He wore Nike Tiempo football boots at the 1994 FIFA World Cup.[130] In 1996, he starred in a Nike commercial titled \"Good vs Evil\" in a gladiatorial game set in a Roman amphitheatre. Appearing alongside football players from around the world, including Ronaldo, Eric Cantona, Luís Figo, Patrick Kluivert and Jorge Campos, they defend \"the beautiful game\" against a team of demonic warriors, with Maldini stating, \"Maybe they\\'re friendly?\" before he starts the move which culminates with Cantona striking the ball and \"destroying evil\".[128]\\nMaldini features in EA Sports\\' FIFA video game series; he was on the cover for the Italian edition of FIFA: Road to World Cup 98,[131] and was named in the Ultimate Team Legends in FIFA 14.[132]\\n\\nPersonal life[edit]\\nMaldini was born on 26 June 1968 in Milan to Cesare Maldini and Maria Luisa De Mezzi.[133] He has been married to Venezuelan former model Adriana Fossa since December 1994.[134][135] The couple have two sons, Christian (born 14 June 1996) and Daniel (born 11 October 2001),[136] who both have been signed by Maldini\\'s former club Milan and played in the youth teams.[137][138] His father Cesare was also a footballer who also played as a defender, captained Milan, and represented the Italy national team, later going on to become a coach. Throughout Cesare\\'s managerial career, he coached his son both in the Italy under-21 side and the senior team, as well as at Milan, also managing several other teams.[139] On 3 April 2016, Paolo\\'s father Cesare died at the age of 84;[140] his mother died later that year, on 28 July.[133][141]\\nMaldini has his own fashion label – Sweet Years – which he runs with friend and former Italy and Milan teammate Christian Vieri.[142][143]\\nOn 21 March 2020, it was confirmed that Maldini and his son Daniel both tested positive for COVID-19, amid its pandemic in Italy;[144][145] by 8 April, he and his son had recovered.[146]\\n\\nCareer statistics[edit]\\nClub[edit]\\n\\nAppearances and goals by club, season and competition[147]\\n\\n\\nTeam\\n\\nSeason\\n\\nLeague\\n\\nCoppa Italia\\n\\nEurope[1]\\n\\nOther[2]\\n\\nTotal\\n\\n\\nDivision\\nApps\\nGoals\\nApps\\nGoals\\nApps\\nGoals\\nApps\\nGoals\\nApps\\nGoals\\n\\n\\nAC Milan\\n\\n1984–85\\n\\nSerie A\\n\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n–\\n–\\n1\\n0\\n\\n\\n1985–86\\n\\nSerie A\\n\\n27\\n0\\n6\\n0\\n6\\n0\\n1[3]\\n0\\n40\\n0\\n\\n\\n1986–87\\n\\nSerie A\\n\\n29\\n1\\n7\\n0\\n–\\n1[4]\\n0\\n37\\n1\\n\\n\\n1987–88\\n\\nSerie A\\n\\n26\\n2\\n1\\n0\\n2\\n0\\n–\\n29\\n2\\n\\n\\n1988–89\\n\\nSerie A\\n\\n26\\n0\\n7\\n0\\n7\\n0\\n–\\n40\\n0\\n\\n\\n1989–90\\n\\nSerie A\\n\\n30\\n1\\n6\\n0\\n8\\n0\\n3\\n0\\n47\\n1\\n\\n\\n1990–91\\n\\nSerie A\\n\\n26\\n4\\n3\\n0\\n4\\n0\\n2\\n0\\n35\\n4\\n\\n\\n1991–92\\n\\nSerie A\\n\\n31\\n3\\n7\\n1\\n–\\n–\\n38\\n4\\n\\n\\n1992–93\\n\\nSerie A\\n\\n31\\n2\\n8\\n0\\n10\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n50\\n3\\n\\n\\n1993–94\\n\\nSerie A\\n\\n30\\n1\\n2\\n0\\n10\\n1\\n4\\n0\\n46\\n2\\n\\n\\n1994–95\\n\\nSerie A\\n\\n29\\n2\\n1\\n0\\n11\\n0\\n2\\n0\\n43\\n2\\n\\n\\n1995–96\\n\\nSerie A\\n\\n30\\n3\\n3\\n0\\n8\\n0\\n–\\n41\\n3\\n\\n\\n1996–97\\n\\nSerie A\\n\\n26\\n1\\n3\\n0\\n6\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n36\\n1\\n\\n\\n1997–98\\n\\nSerie A\\n\\n30\\n0\\n7\\n0\\n–\\n–\\n37\\n0\\n\\n\\n1998–99\\n\\nSerie A\\n\\n31\\n1\\n2\\n0\\n–\\n–\\n33\\n1\\n\\n\\n1999–2000\\n\\nSerie A\\n\\n27\\n1\\n4\\n0\\n6\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n38\\n1\\n\\n\\n2000–01\\n\\nSerie A\\n\\n31\\n1\\n4\\n0\\n14\\n0\\n–\\n49\\n1\\n\\n\\n2001–02\\n\\nSerie A\\n\\n15\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n4\\n0\\n–\\n19\\n0\\n\\n\\n2002–03\\n\\nSerie A\\n\\n29\\n2\\n1\\n0\\n19\\n0\\n–\\n49\\n2\\n\\n\\n2003–04\\n\\nSerie A\\n\\n30\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n9\\n0\\n3\\n0\\n42\\n0\\n\\n\\n2004–05\\n\\nSerie A\\n\\n33\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n13\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n47\\n1\\n\\n\\n2005–06\\n\\nSerie A\\n\\n14\\n2\\n0\\n0\\n9\\n0\\n–\\n23\\n2\\n\\n\\n2006–07\\n\\nSerie A\\n\\n18\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n9\\n0\\n–\\n27\\n1\\n\\n\\n2007–08\\n\\nSerie A\\n\\n17\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n4\\n0\\n2\\n0\\n23\\n1\\n\\n\\n2008–09\\n\\nSerie A\\n\\n30\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n2\\n0\\n–\\n32\\n0\\n\\n\\nCareer total\\n\\n647\\n29\\n72\\n1\\n161\\n3\\n22\\n0\\n902\\n33\\n\\n^ European competitions include the European Cup/UEFA Champions League and UEFA Cup\\n^ Other tournaments include the Supercoppa Italiana, European/UEFA Super Cup, Intercontinental Cup and FIFA Club World Cup\\n^ Play-off for UEFA Cup admission\\n^ Played in the Torneo Estivo del 1986\\n\\nInternational[edit]\\n\\nAppearances and goals by national team and year[61][148]\\n\\n\\nNational team\\nYear\\nApps\\nGoals\\n\\n\\nItaly\\n\\n1988\\n10\\n0\\n\\n\\n1989\\n7\\n0\\n\\n\\n1990\\n11\\n0\\n\\n\\n1991\\n8\\n0\\n\\n\\n1992\\n7\\n0\\n\\n\\n1993\\n5\\n2\\n\\n\\n1994\\n12\\n0\\n\\n\\n1995\\n7\\n1\\n\\n\\n1996\\n7\\n0\\n\\n\\n1997\\n11\\n2\\n\\n\\n1998\\n11\\n1\\n\\n\\n1999\\n7\\n1\\n\\n\\n2000\\n11\\n0\\n\\n\\n2001\\n7\\n0\\n\\n\\n2002\\n5\\n0\\n\\n\\nTotal\\n126\\n7\\n\\nScores and results list Italy\\'s goal tally first, score column indicates score after each Maldini goal.[61]\\n\\nList of international goals scored by Paolo Maldini\\n\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nDate\\n\\nVenue\\n\\nOpponent\\n\\nScore\\n\\nResult\\n\\nCompetition\\n\\n\\n1\\n20 January 1993\\nFlorence, Italy\\n\\xa0Mexico\\n2–0\\n2–0\\nFriendly\\n\\n\\n2\\n24 March 1993\\nPalermo, Italy\\n\\xa0Malta\\n6–1\\n6–1\\n1994 FIFA World Cup qualification\\n\\n\\n3\\n11 November 1995\\nBari, Italy\\n\\xa0Ukraine\\n3–1\\n3–1\\nUEFA Euro 1996 qualification\\n\\n\\n4\\n29 March 1997\\nTrieste, Italy\\n\\xa0Moldova\\n1–0\\n3–0\\n1998 FIFA World Cup qualification\\n\\n\\n5\\n30 April 1997\\nNapoli, Italy\\n\\xa0Poland\\n2–0\\n3–0\\n1998 FIFA World Cup qualification\\n\\n\\n6\\n22 April 1998\\nParma, Italy\\n\\xa0Paraguay\\n1–0\\n3–1\\nFriendly\\n\\n\\n7\\n5 June 1999\\nBologna, Italy\\n\\xa0Wales\\n3–0\\n4–0\\nUEFA Euro 2000 qualification\\n\\nHonours[edit]\\nAC Milan[147][13][26][149][150]\\n\\nSerie A: 1987–88, 1991–92, 1992–93, 1993–94, 1995–96, 1998–99, 2003–04\\nCoppa Italia: 2002–03\\nSupercoppa Italiana: 1988, 1992, 1993, 1994, 2004\\nEuropean Cup/UEFA Champions League: 1988–89, 1989–90, 1993–94, 2002–03, 2006–07\\nEuropean/UEFA Super Cup: 1989, 1990, 1994, 2003\\nIntercontinental Cup: 1989, 1990\\nFIFA Club World Cup: 2007\\nItaly[151]\\n\\nFIFA World Cup runner-up: 1994;

He is regarded as one of the greatest goalkeepers in the history of the sport.[nb 1] Neuer has been described as a \"sweeper-keeper\" because of his playing style and speed when rushing off his line to anticipate opponents, going out of the goalkeeper box.[5][6][30] He was named the best goalkeeper of the decade from 2011 to 2020 by IFFHS.[31]\\nNeuer started his career at Schalke 04 where he won the DFB-Pokal and DFL-Ligapokal. In 2011, he signed for Bayern Munich and has since won 27 trophies, including ten Bundesliga titles and two UEFA Champions League titles in 2013 and 2020, both as part of trebles. In 2014, Neuer finished third in the voting for the FIFA Ballon d\\'Or award behind Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. He was awarded the UEFA Goalkeeper of the Year and the IFFHS World\\'s Best Goalkeeper five times each.\\nNeuer was selected as Germany\\'s number one goalkeeper for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa.[32] During the group stages, he only conceded a single goal. He provided the assist for Miroslav Klose\\'s opening goal against England as Germany won 4–1. Four years later, Neuer won the 2014 FIFA World Cup with Germany as well as the Golden Glove award for being the best goalkeeper in the tournament.[33]\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 Club career\\n\\n1.1 Schalke 04\\n1.2 Bayern Munich\\n\\n1.2.1 2011–13: Transfer and treble winner\\n1.2.2 2013–16: Ballon d\\'Or nomination, domestic success\\n1.2.3 2016–20: Club captain and second treble\\n1.2.4 2020–22: The Sextuple and new records\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2 International career\\n\\n2.1 Youth\\n2.2 2010 World Cup\\n2.3 Euro 2012\\n2.4 2014 World Cup\\n2.5 Euro 2016\\n2.6 2018 World Cup\\n2.7 Euro 2020\\n\\n\\n3 Style of play\\n4 Personal life\\n5 Career statistics\\n\\n5.1 Club\\n5.2 International\\n\\n\\n6 Honours\\n7 Notes\\n8 See also\\n9 References\\n10 External links\\n\\n\\nClub career[edit]\\nSchalke 04[edit]\\n Neuer in 2005\\nNeuer played for Schalke 04 II during 2003–04,[34] 2004–05, 2006–07.[35] 2007–08 and 2008–09[35] Neuer progressed through every age group at his hometown club, Schalke 04, and signed professional terms in 2005. Neuer did not make any first team appearances during the 2005–06 season.[36] He made his Bundesliga debut with Schalke when he came on as a substitute for the injured Frank Rost on matchday 2 of the 2006–07 season. The 20-year-old eventually won the starting position when Rost was surprisingly dropped for the clash against Bayern Munich. Neuer managed to secure a 2–2 draw against the defending champions. He made 27 league appearances during the 2006–07 season.[35] Despite his young age, he was widely tipped to be a potential successor to his former idol Jens Lehmann in the future for the German national team.[37]\\n\\n Neuer in 2007\\nNeuer started the 2007–08 season by playing in three matches in the German League Cup.[38] On 5 March 2008, in the first knockout round of the UEFA Champions League against Porto, he almost single-handedly kept Schalke in the game with several saves, forcing the game into penalties. He then saved penalties from Bruno Alves and Lisandro López to help Schalke advance to the quarter-finals. He was shortlisted for the 2007–08 UEFA Club Goalkeeper of the Year award; he was the youngest as well as the only Bundesliga goalkeeper on the list.[39] He was one of only three Bundesliga players to play every minute in the 2007–08 season. He finished the season by making 50 appearances in all competitions.[40]\\nIn the 2008–09 season, Schalke finished eighth in the league table and missed out on a Europa League spot. However, his showing at the 2009 UEFA European Under-21 Championship sparked interest from Bayern Munich, with Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge declaring interest in signing the young goalkeeper. Schalke\\'s new manager Felix Magath, however, insisted that Neuer would play for Schalke in the next season.[41] In November, he was the only German goalkeeper in the list of five nominated goalkeepers for the UEFA Team of the Year.[42]\\nNeuer finished the 2009–10 season with 39 appearances.[43]\\nFor the 2010–11 season, Neuer was appointed captain and led the team to its first Champions League semi-final appearance to play against Manchester United.[44] He also won the DFB-Pokal in his final season with the club, as Schalke defeated MSV Duisburg 5–0.[45] On 20 April 2011, he announced that he would not be extending his contract with Schalke, which was set to expire at the end of the 2011–12 season.[46] He received criticism from Schalke fans, who were disappointed with him leaving for a rival club. Neuer finished the season with 53 appearances.[47]\\n\\nBayern Munich[edit]\\n2011–13: Transfer and treble winner[edit]\\n Neuer saving Juan Mata\\'s penalty kick in the 2012 UEFA Champions League Final\\nOn 1 June 2011, Neuer made his move to Bayern Munich and signed a five-year contract that lasted until June 2016.[48][49] After hostilities of Bayern fans against Neuer, as some fans were unhappy about Bayern buying a Schalke keeper, a round-table discussion between Bayern and group of supporters\\' representatives took place on 2 July 2011. Among other things, it was decided that Neuer would be regarded as a full member of Bayern Munich, who should be treated with due respect. Furthermore, hostility towards him should cease.[50] In the first weeks at Bayern, after a 0–0 draw with 1899 Hoffenheim, Neuer broke the Bayern Munich record for most competitive clean sheets in a row, having gone over 1,000 minutes without conceding. He improved the record formerly held by Oliver Kahn.[51]\\nOn 25 April 2012, Neuer saved penalty kicks from both Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaká and helped Bayern through the 2011–12 Champions League semi-finals against Real Madrid. Following the match, Neuer revealed that he studied the way Ronaldo took his penalties. Neuer told Bild: \"I always prepare myself for such situations. Our goalkeeping coach, Toni Tapalović, showed me on his laptop before the match how Ronaldo usually takes his penalties. I learned that Ronaldo prefers to send the ball low to his left. In the penalty shoot-out, I was convinced that he would aim for his favourite spot.\"[52]\\nBayern went on to progress to the 2012 UEFA Champions League Final against Chelsea, which also went to a penalty shoot-out after a 1–1 draw. Neuer took and scored the third penalty for Bayern and also saved the first penalty taken by Juan Mata, but could not save the rest of the penalties as Munich lost the trophy 4–3 on penalties in their home stadium, the Allianz Arena. Neuer finished the season with 53 appearances.[53]\\nNeuer started the season by winning the 2012 DFL-Supercup.[54] In the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League knockout phase, Neuer posted four clean sheets in a row versus both Juventus and Barcelona. In the 2013 Champions League Final against Borussia Dortmund, Neuer posted eight saves en route to Bayern\\'s fifth Champions League title. The game featured several saves from both keepers, and Neuer won the duel against Roman Weidenfeller having only conceded once to İlkay Gündoğan on a penalty shot. Neuer finished the season with 31 Bundesliga appearances,[55] five German Cup appearances,[55] 13 UEFA Champions League appearances,[55] and a German Super Cup appearance.[54]\\n\\n2013–16: Ballon d\\'Or nomination, domestic success[edit]\\nNeuer started the season by losing in the 2013 DFL-Supercup to Borussia Dortmund.[56] For the 2013 UEFA Super Cup, on 30 August 2013, he saved the last and decisive penalty which saw Bayern Munich win the match against Chelsea, taking some revenge for the lost 2012 UEFA Champions League final.[57] In the FIFA Club World Cup, Neuer played against Guangzhou Evergrande in the semi-final[58] and Raja Casablanca in the final.[59] Neuer was announced as the 2013 World Goalkeeper of The Year on 7 January 2014.[60] On 9 February, Bayern faced Arsenal in the Champions League knockout phase and Neuer saved the penalty from Mesut Özil in the first half. Bayern went on to win the game 2–0 away. On 2 May 2014, Neuer extended his contract until the summer of 2019.[61] Neuer finished the season with 31 Bundesliga appearances,[62] five German Cup appearances,[62] 12 UEFA Champions League appearances,[62] one German Super Cup appearance,[56] one UEFA Super Cup appearance,[57] and two FIFA Club World Cup appearances[58][59] for a total of 52 appearances.\\nNeuer won the Footballer of the Year (Germany) prize,[63] was voted into the UEFA Team of the Year,[64] and finished third in the FIFA Ballon d\\'Or.[65] Neuer started the season by losing the 2014 DFL-Supercup to Borussia Dortmund.[66] On 30 January 2015, Neuer started[67] on matchday 18, where Bayern lost to VfL Wolfsburg 4–1.[68] This was the first league match since joining Bayern in 2011 where he had given up four goals in a match. The last time Bayern had conceded four goals in a match was against Wolfsburg on 4 April 2009.[68] On 28 April 2015, Neuer was one of four Bayern players to miss in a 2–0 penalty shootout defeat to Borussia Dortmund in the DFB-Pokal semi-final.[69] Neuer finished the season with 32 Bundesliga appearances,[70] five German Cup appearances,[70] 12 UEFA Champions League appearances,[70] and one German Super Cup appearance[66] for a total of 50 appearances.\\nThe  2015-16 season season started[71] when Neuer started in the 1–1 draw against VfL Wolfsburg in the 2015 DFL-Supercup.[72] Wolfsburg won the subsequent shootout.[72] On 20 April 2016, Neuer extended his contract with Bayern until 2021. Neuer finished the season with 34 Bundesliga appearances,[73] five German Cup appearances,[73] 11 UEFA Champions League appearances,[73] and one German Supercup Cup appearance[72] for a total of 51 appearances.\\n\\n2016–20: Club captain and second treble[edit]\\nNeuer\\'s season began with a 2–0 win over Borussia Dortmund at the 2016 DFL-Supercup[74] as FC Bayern won the title for the first time in three years, and he kept a clean sheet in the Bundesliga opener as FC Bayern grabbed a 6–0 win over Werder Bremen. In January 2017, he was voted into the FIFA Team of the Year alongside fellow German and former Bayern teammate Toni Kroos. Neuer conceded twice in FC Bayern\\'s matches against Arsenal as the Bavarians beat the English team with an impressive 10–2 aggregate in the round of 16 of the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League. Neuer was then praised for his performance in their first game of the quarterfinals against Real Madrid, although Bayern lost 1–2 to the Spanish club. During the second leg, he suffered a left foot fracture that ended his season abruptly as Bayern lost 4–2 in a controversial match.[75] Bayern ended the season as Bundesliga champions. In addition to playing in the DFL-Supercup,[74] Neuer played in 26 Bundesliga matches, four German Cup matches, and nine Champions League matches.[76]\\n\\n Neuer training in 2017\\nOn 19 July 2017, it was announced that Neuer would become the new captain for both Bayern and the German national team following Philipp Lahm\\'s retirement.[77] Neuer played his first game of the season on Bundesliga matchday 2 after recovering from a foot injury that occurred in April during a Champions League game versus Real Madrid.[78] On 13 September 2017, Neuer made his 100th European appearance in a Champions League match as his side won 3–0 over Anderlecht.[79] It was announced in September that Neuer would be ruled out until January 2018 after another fracture to the same foot again.[80] After series of delays on his comeback, he finally rejoined team training with Bayern Munich on 20 April 2018 after seven months away, although he had begun goalkeeping-specific training in early April.[81] Neuer was included in the matchday squad for the first time since his injury in the DFB-Pokal final against Eintracht Frankfurt but he was an unused substitute.[82] Neuer finished the season with three Bundesliga matches and a Champions League match.[83]\\nOn 12 August 2018, Neuer captained his side in the first competitive match of the season as Bayern won the 2018 DFL-Supercup by defeating Eintracht Frankfurt with a 5–0 victory.[84] On 24 August, Neuer played his first Bundesliga game in 341 days when he captained Bayern in a 3–1 victory season opener against Hoffenheim.[85][86] On 14 April 2019, Neuer sustained a torn muscle fibres in his left calf in a Bundesliga match against Fortuna Düsseldorf. Due to the injury, Neuer missed six matches for Bayern in the closing stages of the season.[87]\\nOn 18 May 2019, Neuer won his seventh consecutive Bundesliga title as Bayern finished two points above Dortmund. A week later, Neuer returned from injury and won his fifth DFB-Pokal as Bayern defeated RB Leipzig 3–0 in the 2019 DFB-Pokal Final.[88] Neuer finished the season with 26 Bundesliga matches, 3 German Cup matches and 8 Champions League matches. Neuer\\'s 2019–20 started with a 2–0 loss to Borussia Dortmund in the German Super Cup on 3 August 2019.[89] On 21 May 2020, Neuer signed a new contract with Bayern, keeping him at the club until 2023.[90] On 23 August, Neuer won the Champions League for the second time, his first as Bayern captain, keeping a clean sheet as his team won 1–0 over PSG. He was widely praised for his performance.[91] He finished the season with 33 Bundesliga appearances, six German Cup appearances, and 11 UEFA Champions League appearances.[92]\\n\\n2020–22: The Sextuple and new records[edit]\\nOn 24 September 2020, Neuer saved a one-on-one chance from Sevilla\\'s Youssef En-Nesyri in the 87th minute in the 2020 UEFA Super Cup, which Bayern Munich won 2–1 after extra-time.[93] Six days later, Neuer won the German Super Cup.[94] On 21 October 2020, Neuer reached his 200th clean sheet with Bayern in 394 matches in a 4–0 win over Atlético Madrid in the 2020–21 UEFA Champions League. His record surpassed Sepp Maier (199 clean sheets in 651 games), with only Oliver Kahn (247 clean sheets in 632 matches) ahead of Neuer.[95] On 28 August 2021, Neuer had his 205th clean sheet in Bundesliga in 441 matches, breaking Oliver Kahn\\'s record of 204 clean sheets in 557 matches.[96]\\nNeuer\\'s 300th Bundesliga victory came in his 447th Bundesliga game on 23 October 2021.[97]\\n\\nInternational career[edit]\\nYouth[edit]\\nAfter progressing through the youth teams, Neuer made his Germany under-21 debut on 15 August 2006 against the Netherlands. He won the 2009 UEFA European Under-21 Championship with Germany in Sweden, and kept a clean sheet in the 4–0 win in the final against England.[98]\\n\\n2010 World Cup[edit]\\nNeuer was called up on 19 May 2009 to the senior German squad for a tour of Asia.[99] He made his debut on this tour in a match against the United Arab Emirates on 2 June.[100] He played in the November friendly against the Ivory Coast that ended 2–2. Although he took responsibility for the first goal conceded, manager Joachim Löw refused to blame him and instead commended him for doing his best.[101]\\nThe death of keeper Robert Enke in November 2009 saw him elevated to second choice goalkeeper behind René Adler. Adler, however, suffered a serious rib injury which ruled him out of the upcoming 2010 World Cup; Neuer became Germany\\'s first choice goalkeeper ahead of Tim Wiese and Hans-Jörg Butt for the tournament.[102]\\nNeuer was selected as Germany\\'s number one goalkeeper for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.[103] During the group stages, he only conceded a single goal, a close range shot by Milan Jovanović in the match against Serbia. He provided the assist for Miroslav Klose\\'s opening goal against England, winning 4–1. In the same match, England player Frank Lampard scored a goal that was erroneously disallowed since the referee ruled incorrectly that the ball had not crossed the line. Controversially, Neuer admitted that he knew it was a legitimate goal, but acted in a way to make the referee doubt this.[104] He played in all of Germany\\'s World Cup matches apart from the third-place game against Uruguay, when Hans-Jörg Butt was rewarded with a spot in the starting lineup.[105]\\n\\nEuro 2012[edit]\\n Neuer in action for Germany in their Euro 2012 group stage match against Netherlands on 13 June\\nNeuer played every minute of every match in the qualification campaign for UEFA Euro 2012, helping Germany to secure ten wins out of ten games and top their group. After Germany\\'s 3–1 away win against Turkey, he was especially praised for his \"sensational\" performance.[citation needed] He retained a close range volley shot by Hamit Altıntop, and then he quickly threw the ball to the halfway line into the feet of Thomas Müller, who immediately provided the assist for Mario Gómez\\'s opening goal. Neuer then set up the second goal; under pressure by Turkish attackers, he fired a precise long range kick to Mario Götze deep in the opponent\\'s half, who then found Müller on the edge of the opponent\\'s penalty box to score.[106] Neuer started all three of Germany\\'s matches in the oft-dubbed \"Group of Death\", Group B. He kept a clean sheet against Portugal while also conceding one goal each to the Netherlands and Denmark. Germany went on to win Group B; they were the only team in the tournament to win all of their group stage games. He finished group play posting two saves against Portugal, three against the Netherlands and three again against Denmark.[citation needed]\\n\\n2014 World Cup[edit]\\n Neuer training before the match against Brazil at the 2014 FIFA World Cup on 7 July\\nNeuer\\'s \"sweeper-keeper\" playing style distinguished him from other starting goalkeepers in the 2014 World Cup. This was credited with allowing his teammates to press deep in their opponents\\' half; in addition, Neuer\\'s willingness to come out and challenge opposing attackers caused them to miss shots.[107] Neuer\\'s outfield roaming, which had made him the team\\'s \"11th man\", has been attributed to the coaching he received from Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola.[108]\\nAfter keeping clean sheets in group matches against Portugal and the United States, Neuer had an outstanding performance in a 2–1 win against Algeria after extra time in the round of 16, when he had to play as a sweeper-keeper to defend their counter-attacks.[109] He recorded his third clean sheet of the World Cup in the 1–0 quarter-final defeat of France. This was his 22nd clean sheet overall in his 50th appearance for die Nationalmannschaft.[110] In the semi-finals, Neuer conceded a late goal as his team routed hosts Brazil 7–1.[111]\\nOn 13 July, in the FIFA World Cup Final against Argentina, Neuer was not heavily tested, but he nonetheless commanded his penalty area well, challenging attacking runs by Gonzalo Higuaín and Rodrigo Palacio that caused them to shoot wide of the net. Argentina finished the match without a shot on goal, despite several good chances, including a Higuaín goal disallowed for offside.[107] Early in the second half, Neuer punched the ball clear before colliding with Higuaín at the edge of the box. Germany ultimately defeated Argentina 1–0 thanks to a Mario Götze goal in extra time. Neuer won the Golden Glove award for the tournament\\'s best goalkeeper.[112] Neuer also finished the tournament with 244 completed passes, more than outfield players like Lionel Messi (242), Wesley Sneijder (242), and Thomas Müller (221).[113]\\n\\nEuro 2016[edit]\\nOn 31 May 2016, Neuer was selected for Germany\\'s final 23 man squad for UEFA Euro 2016. During the tournament, Neuer did not concede any goals during Germany\\'s three group games against Ukraine, Poland and Northern Ireland. He also kept a clean sheet in the round of 16 against Slovakia.[114] During the quarter-finals, on 2 July 2016, he finally conceded a goal against Italy from a Leonardo Bonucci penalty kick; Neuer established a new record by not conceding a goal in a major tournament for 557 minutes. The previous record-holder was his compatriot Sepp Maier, who did not concede a goal for 481 minutes. A 1–1 draw after extra-time saw the match go to a penalty shoot-out, in which Neuer helped Germany to a 6–5 victory by saving two spot kicks, including one from Bonucci; he was elected the Man of the Match for his performance.[115][116]\\n\\n2018 World Cup[edit]\\nPrior to the start of qualification, on 1 September 2016, Neuer was named new captain of the national team, following Bastian Schweinsteiger\\'s retirement from international football.[117] On 15 May 2018, Neuer was selected in Germany\\'s 27-man preliminary squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup even though he had not played a match since fracturing his foot for a second time in September 2017.[118] Neuer made his first appearance since his injury on 2 June, in a 2–1 friendly defeat to Austria in Klagenfurt.[119] On 4 June, Neuer was selected in the final 23-man squad for the World Cup.[120] On 17 June, Neuer captained his side for the first time in the World Cup in their opening match in which they lost 1–0 to Mexico.[121] On 23 June, Neuer made several saves as his side defeated Sweden with a 2–1 victory in their second group stage match, which kept the Germans from being knocked out of the World Cup.[122] However, his side were knocked out of the tournament after losing 2–0 to South Korea in their last group stage match.[123]\\n\\nEuro 2020[edit]\\nOn 11 June 2019, in Germany\\'s UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying 8–0 victory over Estonia, Neuer kept the 37th clean sheet of his international career, breaking a record set by Sepp Maier.[124] On 19 May 2021, Neuer was selected for the squad for the UEFA Euro 2020.[125]\\nOn 7 June 2021, he achieved his 100th cap with the national team in a friendly match against Latvia,[126] becoming the first German goalkeeper to reach that milestone.[127]\\nUEFA began investigating Neuer for wearing rainbow-coloured captain\\'s armband at the Euros to commemorate Pride month. They later confirmed it did not breach tournament rules against making on-field political statements.[128]\\n\\nStyle of play[edit]\\n Argentina\\'s Higuaín challenging Germany\\'s Hummels and Neuer during the final of the 2014 FIFA World Cup\\nConsidered by some in the media to be the current best goalkeeper in the world, and one of the greatest goalkeepers both of his generation and of all time, Neuer is widely regarded as a \"complete\" and modern goalkeeper. He is regarded by some pundits to be the best goalkeeper of the modern era, with Peter Staunton of Goal.com labelling him as \"the best goalkeeper since Yashin,\" who is currently the only goalkeeper ever to have won the Ballon d\\'Or.[nb 1][nb 2]\\nA tall, large, athletic, and physically strong player, Neuer has earned critical acclaim from former players and pundits for his speed, stamina, composure, concentration, consistency, and mentality, as well as for being able to adapt to any given situation on the pitch. He is particularly known for his exceptional reflexes, shot-stopping abilities (with both his arms and legs), agility, speed, and footwork, as well as his handling, capacity to read the game, and ability to come out to collect crosses, which enables him to command his area effectively. When the situation demands, he will also often essentially fill the role of a sweeper when opposing players have beaten the offside trap or his team\\'s defensive line by quickly rushing out of goal to anticipate opponents and clear the ball; his skill, speed and decision-making in this area enables his teams to maintain a high defensive line. Because of his unique playing style, Neuer has been described as a \"sweeper-keeper\", and has been credited with revolutionising the role of the goalkeeper in modern times. He has also been praised by pundits for his positioning between the posts, as well as his ability in one-on-one situations; furthermore, he is effective at stopping penalties, and has also been known to take and score them in shoot-outs.[nb 1]\\nA former outfield player in his youth, in addition to his goalkeeping ability, Neuer has also been praised for his excellent ball control and for his accurate distribution of the ball with both his hands and feet; his long throwing range and ability to kick the ball into deep areas with either foot enables him to play the ball out on the ground or create plays or launch swift counter-attacks from the back. Regarding his technical skills on the ball in comparison to other players in his role, Neuer has stated that he could play in the German third division as a centre-back if so desired. Due to his authoritative leadership and vocal presence in goal, he also excels at communicating with his defenders and organising his team\\'s defensive line.[nb 1] In 2015, Gianluigi Buffon described Neuer as the best goalkeeper of his era in the air.[129]\\nDespite the praise for his style of play and role in the development of the goalkeeper position in football, Neuer has also received criticism in the German media for his reflex-like objection to attacking moves in his box regardless of whether they violate rules or not. In particular, his tendency to instantaneously raise his arm to alert the referee has led to the creation of the German word Reklamierarm (roughly translated: arm of objection) in German media.[130]\\n\\nPersonal life[edit]\\nNeuer was born in Gelsenkirchen, North Rhine-Westphalia.[131] He attended Gesamtschule Berger Feld, like many other footballers, such as Mesut Özil. His brother Marcel is currently a football referee in the Verbandsliga.[132] He received his first football when he was two, and he had his first game on 3 March 1991, 24 days before his fifth birthday.[133] Neuer\\'s hero and idol as a child was fellow German and former Schalke goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.[134]\\nNeuer is Catholic, and lends his support to a Gelsenkirchen-based Catholic social action group which campaigns against child poverty and a Gelsenkirchen-based youth club run by the Amigonians.[135]\\nNeuer started a charity foundation for children, named the Manuel Neuer Kids Foundation.[136] In November 2011, he won €500,000 for charity in a celebrity edition of Wer wird Millionär?, the German version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?[137]\\nNeuer was in a relationship with Kathrin Glich until 2014.[138] In 2015, Neuer started a relationship with Nina Weiss.[139] On 21 May 2017, Neuer and Weiss married in Tannheim, Austria, in a civil ceremony, which was followed by a church wedding in the Cathedral of Santissima della Madia in Monopoli, Italy, on 10 June.[140][141] The couple separated in early 2020, and Neuer started dating Anika Bissel.[142]\\nAfter an erroneous translation of his statement \"it would be good if a professional football player came out because it would help others to do the same\", a South American publication concluded that he was gay, which was taken up by many other media outlets and has since been widely believed in some Latin American countries.[143][144] Mexico were fined for their fans\\' homophobic chants when Neuer had the ball during a World Cup match in 2018.[145]\\n\\nCareer statistics[edit]\\nClub[edit]\\nAs of match played 23 April 2022\\n\\nAppearances and goals by club, season and
